This option is hence a security risk when used outside of test systems, since the (possibly) only seed used for initialization of the kernel's entropy pool might be easily acquired by unprivileged programs.\n\nIt is recommended to pass 512 bytes of randomized data (as that matches the Linux kernel pool size), which may be generated with a command like the following:\n\ndd if=/dev/urandom bs=512 count=1 status=none | base64 -w 0\n\nAgain: do not use this option outside of testing environments, it's a security risk elsewhere, as secret key material derived from the entropy pool can possibly be reconstructed by unprivileged programs.",
