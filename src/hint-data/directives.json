[4,1,"Specifies an address to listen on for a stream (`SOCK_STREAM`), datagram (`SOCK_DGRAM`), or sequential packet (`SOCK_SEQPACKET`) socket, respectively. The address can be written in various formats:\n\nIf the address starts with a slash (\"`/`\"), it is read as file system socket in the `AF_UNIX` socket family.\n\nIf the address starts with an at symbol (\"`@`\"), it is read as abstract namespace socket in the `AF_UNIX` family. The \"`@`\" is replaced with a `NUL` character before binding. For details, see [unix(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html).\n\nIf the address string is a single number, it is read as port number to listen on via IPv6. Depending on the value of `BindIPv6Only=` (see below) this might result in the service being available via both IPv6 and IPv4 (default) or just via IPv6.\n\nIf the address string is a string in the format \"``_`v.w.x.y`_:_`z`_``\", it is interpreted as IPv4 address _`v.w.x.y`_ and port _`z`_.\n\nIf the address string is a string in the format \"``[_`x`_]:_`y`_``\", it is interpreted as IPv6 address _`x`_ and port _`y`_. An optional interface scope (interface name or number) may be specified after a \"`%`\" symbol: \"``[_`x`_]:_`y`_%_`dev`_``\". Interface scopes are only useful with link-local addresses, because the kernel ignores them in other cases. Note that if an address is specified as IPv6, it might still make the service available via IPv4 too, depending on the `BindIPv6Only=` setting (see below).\n\nIf the address string is a string in the format \"``vsock:_`x`_:_`y`_``\", it is read as CID _`x`_ on a port _`y`_ address in the `AF_VSOCK` family. The CID is a unique 32-bit integer identifier in `AF_VSOCK` analogous to an IP address. Specifying the CID is optional, and may be set to the empty string.\n\nNote that `SOCK_SEQPACKET` (i.e. `ListenSequentialPacket=`) is only available for `AF_UNIX` sockets. `SOCK_STREAM` (i.e. `ListenStream=`) when used for IP sockets refers to TCP sockets, `SOCK_DGRAM` (i.e. `ListenDatagram=`) to UDP.\n\nThese options may be specified more than once, in which case incoming traffic on any of the sockets will trigger service activation, and all listed sockets will be passed to the service, regardless of whether there is incoming traffic on them or not. If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of addresses to listen on is reset, all prior uses of any of these options will have no effect.\n\nIt is also possible to have more than one socket unit for the same service when using `Service=`, and the service will receive all the sockets configured in all the socket units. Sockets configured in one unit are passed in the order of configuration, but no ordering between socket units is specified.\n\nIf an IP address is used here, it is often desirable to listen on it before the interface it is configured on is up and running, and even regardless of whether it will be up and running at any point.

In containers, for the system manager instance, this is mapped to `OnStartupSec=`, making both equivalent.\n\n`OnStartupSec=`\n\nDefines a timer relative to when the service manager was first started. For system timer units this is very similar to `OnBootSec=` as the system service manager is generally started very early at boot. It's primarily useful when configured in units running in the per-user service manager, as the user service manager is generally started on first login only, not already during boot.\n\n`OnUnitActiveSec=`\n\nDefines a timer relative to when the unit the timer unit is activating was last activated.\n\n`OnUnitInactiveSec=`\n\nDefines a timer relative to when the unit the timer unit is activating was last deactivated.\n\n  \n\nMultiple directives may be combined of the same and of different types, in which case the timer unit will trigger whenever any of the specified timer expressions elapse. For example, by combining `OnBootSec=` and `OnUnitActiveSec=`, it is possible to define a timer that elapses in regular intervals and activates a specific service each time. Moreover, both monotonic time expressions and `OnCalendar=` calendar expressions may be combined in the same timer unit.\n\nThe arguments to the directives are time spans configured in seconds. Example: \"OnBootSec=50\" means 50s after boot-up. The argument may also include time units. Example: \"OnBootSec=5h 30min\" means 5 hours and 30 minutes after boot-up. For details about the syntax of time spans, see [systemd.time(7)](systemd.time.html#).\n\nIf a timer configured with `OnBootSec=` or `OnStartupSec=` is already in the past when the timer unit is activated, it will immediately elapse and the configured unit is started. This is not the case for timers defined in the other directives.\n\nThese are monotonic timers, independent of wall-clock time and timezones. If the computer is temporarily suspended, the monotonic clock generally pauses, too. Note that if `WakeSystem=` is used, a different monotonic clock is selected that continues to advance while the system is suspended and thus can be used as the trigger to resume the system.\n\nIf the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of timers is reset (both monotonic timers and `OnCalendar=` timers, see below), and all prior assignments will have no effect.\n\nNote that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time configured with these settings, as they are subject to the `AccuracySec=` setting below."],

Within this time window, the expiry time will be placed at a host-specific, randomized, but stable position that is synchronized between all local timer units. This is done in order to optimize power consumption to suppress unnecessary CPU wake-ups. To get best accuracy, set this option to 1us. Note that the timer is still subject to the timer slack configured via [systemd-system.conf(5)](systemd-system.conf.html#)'s `TimerSlackNSec=` setting.

It should not be confused with `RandomizedDelaySec=` (see below) which adds a random value to the time the timer shall elapse next and whose purpose is the opposite: to stretch elapsing of timer events over a longer period to reduce workload spikes.

If `RandomizedDelaySec=` and `AccuracySec=` are used in conjunction, first the randomized delay is added, and then the result is possibly further shifted to coalesce it with other timer events happening on the system. As mentioned above `AccuracySec=` defaults to 1 minute and `RandomizedDelaySec=` to 0, thus encouraging coalescing of timer events.

Also, some unit types may deactivate on their own (for example, a service process may decide to exit cleanly, or a device may be unplugged by the user), which is not propagated to units having a `Requires=` dependency.

Units can suddenly, unexpectedly enter inactive state for different reasons: the main process of a service unit might terminate on its own choice, the backing device of a device unit might be unplugged or the mount point of a mount unit might be unmounted without involvement of the system and service manager.\n\nWhen used in conjunction with `After=` on the same unit the behaviour of `BindsTo=` is even stronger. In this case, the unit bound to strictly has to be in active state for this unit to also be in active state. This not only means a unit bound to another unit that suddenly enters inactive state, but also one that is bound to another unit that gets skipped due to a failed condition check (such as `ConditionPathExists=`, `ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=`, … — see below) will be stopped, should it be running.

I.e. if a unit is configured with `After=` on another unit, the former is stopped before the latter if both are shut down. Given two units with any ordering dependency between them, if one unit is shut down and the other is started up, the shutdown is ordered before the start-up. It doesn't matter if the ordering dependency is `After=` or `Before=`, in this case. It also doesn't matter which of the two is shut down, as long as one is shut down and the other is started up; the shutdown is ordered before the start-up in all cases. If two units have no ordering dependencies between them, they are shut down or started up simultaneously, and no ordering takes place. It depends on the unit type when precisely a unit has finished starting up. Most importantly, for service units start-up is considered completed for the purpose of `Before=`/`After=` when all its configured start-up commands have been invoked and they either failed or reported start-up success.

The latter is useful to allow-list all current and future devices belonging to a specific device group at once. The device group is matched according to filename globbing rules, you may hence use the \"`*`\" and \"`?`\" wildcards. (Note that such globbing wildcards are not available for device node path specifications!) In order to match device nodes by numeric major/minor, use device node paths in the `/dev/char/` and `/dev/block/` directories. However, matching devices by major/minor is generally not recommended as assignments are neither stable nor portable between systems or different kernel versions.\n\nExamples: `/dev/sda5` is a path to a device node, referring to an ATA or SCSI block device. \"`char-pts`\" and \"`char-alsa`\" are specifiers for all pseudo TTYs and all ALSA sound devices, respectively. \"`char-cpu/*`\" is a specifier matching all CPU related device groups.\n\nNote that allow lists defined this way should only reference device groups which are resolvable at the time the unit is started. Any device groups not resolvable then are not added to the device allow list. In order to work around this limitation, consider extending service units with a pair of **After=modprobe@xyz.service** and **Wants=modprobe@xyz.service** lines that load the necessary kernel module implementing the device group if missing. Example:\n\n…\n\\[Unit\\]\nWants=modprobe@loop.service\nAfter=modprobe@loop.service\n\n\\[Service\\]\nDeviceAllow=block-loop\nDeviceAllow=/dev/loop-control\n…"],

For unprivileged services (i.e. those using the `User=` setting) the unit's control group will be made accessible to the relevant user. When enabled the service manager will refrain from manipulating control groups or moving processes below the unit's control group, so that a clear concept of ownership is established: the control group tree above the unit's control group (i.e. towards the root control group) is owned and managed by the service manager of the host, while the control group tree below the unit's control group is owned and managed by the unit itself.

[4,186,"Set the UNIX user or group that the processes are executed as, respectively. Takes a single user or group name, or a numeric ID as argument. For system services (services run by the system service manager, i.e. managed by PID 1) and for user services of the root user (services managed by root's instance of **systemd --user**), the default is \"`root`\", but `User=` may be used to specify a different user. For user services of any other user, switching user identity is not permitted, hence the only valid setting is the same user the user's service manager is running as. If no group is set, the default group of the user is used. This setting does not affect commands whose command line is prefixed with \"`+`\".\n\nNote that this enforces only weak restrictions on the user/group name syntax, but will generate warnings in many cases where user/group names do not adhere to the following rules: the specified name should consist only of the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \"`_`\" and \"`-`\", except for the first character which must be one of a-z, A-Z and \"`_`\" (i.e. digits and \"`-`\" are not permitted as first character). The user/group name must have at least one character, and at most 31. These restrictions are made in order to avoid ambiguities and to ensure user/group names and unit files remain portable among Linux systems. For further details on the names accepted and the names warned about see [User/Group Name Syntax](https://systemd.io/USER_NAMES).\n\nWhen used in conjunction with `DynamicUser=` the user/group name specified is dynamically allocated at the time the service is started, and released at the time the service is stopped — unless it is already allocated statically (see below). If `DynamicUser=` is not used the specified user and group must have been created statically in the user database no later than the moment the service is started, for example using the [sysusers.d(5)](sysusers.d.html#) facility, which is applied at boot or package install time. If the user does not exist by then program invocation will fail.\n\nIf the `User=` setting is used the supplementary group list is initialized from the specified user's default group list, as defined in the system's user and group database. Additional groups may be configured through the `SupplementaryGroups=` setting (see below)."],
[4,187,"Takes a boolean parameter. If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated dynamically when the unit is started, and released as soon as it is stopped. The user and group will not be added to `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group`, but are managed transiently during runtime. The [nss-systemd(8)](nss-systemd.html#) glibc NSS module provides integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system's user and group databases. The user and group name to use may be configured via `User=` and `Group=` (see above). If these options are not used and dynamic user/group allocation is enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly derived from the unit name. If the unit name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is used directly, otherwise a name incorporating a hash of it is used. If a statically allocated user or group of the configured name already exists, it is used and no dynamic user/group is allocated. Note that if `User=` is specified and the static group with the name exists, then it is required that the static user with the name already exists. Similarly, if `Group=` is specified and the static user with the name exists, then it is required that the static group with the name already exists. Dynamic users/groups are allocated from the UID/GID range 61184…65519. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users. At any point in time each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use. However, UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated. Care should be taken that any processes running as part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories. If `DynamicUser=` is enabled, `RemoveIPC=` and `PrivateTmp=` are implied (and cannot be turned off). This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic user/group. Since `/tmp/` and `/var/tmp/` are usually the only world-writable directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination. Furthermore `NoNewPrivileges=` and `RestrictSUIDSGID=` are implicitly enabled (and cannot be disabled), to ensure that processes invoked cannot take benefit or create SUID/SGID files or directories. Moreover `ProtectSystem=strict` and `ProtectHome=read-only` are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they have to be allow-listed using `ReadWritePaths=`, but care must be taken so that UID/GID recycling doesn't create security issues involving files created by the service. Use `RuntimeDirectory=` (see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated. Use `StateDirectory=`, `CacheDirectory=` and `LogsDirectory=` in order to assign a set of writable directories for specific purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse (see below). If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit's processes do not get access to directories outside of these explicitly configured and managed ones. Specifically, do not use `BindPaths=` and be careful with `AF_UNIX` file descriptor passing for directory file descriptors, as this would permit processes to create files or directories owned by the dynamic user/group that are not subject to the lifecycle and access guarantees of the service.

[4,197,"Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See [setrlimit(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setrlimit.2.html) for details on the resource limit concept. Resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair `soft:hard` to set both limits individually (e.g. \"`LimitAS=4G:16G`\"). Use the string `infinity` to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. \"`LimitAS=16G`\"). For the limits referring to time values, the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see [systemd.time(7)](systemd.time.html#) for details). Note that if no time unit is specified for `LimitCPU=` the default unit of seconds is implied, while for `LimitRTTIME=` the default unit of microseconds is implied. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified for `LimitCPU=` will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For `LimitNICE=` the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed with \"`+`\" or \"`-`\", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20…19. If not prefixed like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0…40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).\n\nNote that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set. Also note that `LimitRSS=` is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in [systemd.resource-control(5)](systemd.resource-control.html#) over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, `MemoryMax=` is a more powerful (and working) replacement for `LimitRSS=`.\n\nResource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various `DefaultLimitCPU=`, `DefaultLimitFSIZE=`, … options available in [systemd-system.conf(5)](systemd-system.conf.html#), and – if not configured there – the kernel or per-user defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).\n\nFor system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so. In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager, i.e. the user's instance of `user@.service`. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.\n\n**Table 1. Resource limit directives, their equivalent ulimit shell commands and the unit used**\n\nDirective\n\n**ulimit** equivalent\n\nUnit\n\nLimitCPU=\n\nulimit -t\n\nSeconds\n\nLimitFSIZE=\n\nulimit -f\n\nBytes\n\nLimitDATA=\n\nulimit -d\n\nBytes\n\nLimitSTACK=\n\nulimit -s\n\nBytes\n\nLimitCORE=\n\nulimit -c\n\nBytes\n\nLimitRSS=\n\nulimit -m\n\nBytes\n\nLimitNOFILE=\n\nulimit -n\n\nNumber of File Descriptors\n\nLimitAS=\n\nulimit -v\n\nBytes\n\nLimitNPROC=\n\nulimit -u\n\nNumber of Processes\n\nLimitMEMLOCK=\n\nulimit -l\n\nBytes\n\nLimitLOCKS=\n\nulimit -x\n\nNumber of Locks\n\nLimitSIGPENDING=\n\nulimit -i\n\nNumber of Queued Signals\n\nLimitMSGQUEUE=\n\nulimit -q\n\nBytes\n\nLimitNICE=\n\nulimit -e\n\nNice Level\n\nLimitRTPRIO=\n\nulimit -r\n\nRealtime Priority\n\nLimitRTTIME=\n\nNo equivalent\n\nMicroseconds"],

This list is defined statically in systemd based on a kernel version that was available when this systemd version was released. It will become progressively more out-of-date as the kernel is updated.\n\n  \nNote, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be added to the groups above. Contents of the sets may also change between systemd versions. In addition, the list of system calls depends on the kernel version and architecture for which systemd was compiled. Use **systemd-analyze syscall-filter** to list the actual list of system calls in each filter.\n\nGenerally, allow-listing system calls (rather than deny-listing) is the safer mode of operation. It is recommended to enforce system call allow lists for all long-running system services. Specifically, the following lines are a relatively safe basic choice for the majority of system services:\n\n\\[Service\\]\nSystemCallFilter=@system-service\nSystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM\n\nNote that various kernel system calls are defined redundantly: there are multiple system calls for executing the same operation. For example, the `pidfd_send_signal()` system call may be used to execute operations similar to what can be done with the older `kill()` system call, hence blocking the latter without the former only provides weak protection. Since new system calls are added regularly to the kernel as development progresses, keeping system call deny lists comprehensive requires constant work. It is thus recommended to use allow-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system calls are by default implicitly blocked until the allow list is updated.\n\nAlso note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to work. The dynamic linker is required for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF binaries, which is how most distributions build packaged programs). This means that blocking these system calls (which include `open()`, `openat()` or `mmap()`) will make most programs typically shipped with generic distributions unusable.\n\nIt is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with `SystemCallFilter=~@mount`, in order to prohibit the unit's processes to undo the mappings. Specifically these are the options `PrivateTmp=`, `PrivateDevices=`, `ProtectSystem=`, `ProtectHome=`, `ProtectKernelTunables=`, `ProtectControlGroups=`, `ProtectKernelLogs=`, `ProtectClock=`, `ReadOnlyPaths=`, `InaccessiblePaths=` and `ReadWritePaths=`."],

The special identifier `native` implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more precisely: to the architecture the system manager is compiled for). If running in user mode, or in system mode, but without the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability (e.g. setting `User=`), `NoNewPrivileges=yes` is implied. By default, this option is set to the empty list, i.e. no filtering is applied.\n\nIf this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and system calls of the specified architectures. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated as including x86-64 system calls. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on x32.\n\nSystem call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures. For example, on x86 filtering of network socket-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations — a limitation that x86-64 does not have, however. On systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time — such as x86/x86-64 — it is hence recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary ABIs may not be used to circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system. In particular, setting `SystemCallArchitectures=native` is a good choice for disabling non-native ABIs.\n\nSystem call architectures may also be restricted system-wide via the `SystemCallArchitectures=` option in the global configuration.

If the terminal is already being controlled by another process, the executed process waits until the current controlling process releases the terminal.\n\n`tty-force` is similar to `tty`, but the executed process is forcefully and immediately made the controlling process of the terminal, potentially removing previous controlling processes from the terminal.\n\n`tty-fail` is similar to `tty`, but if the terminal already has a controlling process start-up of the executed process fails.\n\nThe `data` option may be used to configure arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via standard input to the executed process. The data to pass is configured via `StandardInputText=`/`StandardInputData=` (see below). Note that the actual file descriptor type passed (memory file, regular file, UNIX pipe, …) might depend on the kernel and available privileges. In any case, the file descriptor is read-only, and when read returns the specified data followed by EOF.\n\nThe ``file:_`path`_`` option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard input. An absolute path following the \"`:`\" character is expected, which may refer to a regular file, a FIFO or special file. If an `AF_UNIX` socket in the file system is specified, a stream socket is connected to it. The latter is useful for connecting standard input of processes to arbitrary system services.\n\nThe `socket` option is valid in socket-activated services only, and requires the relevant socket unit file (see [systemd.socket(5)](systemd.socket.html#) for details) to have `Accept=yes` set, or to specify a single socket only. If this option is set, standard input will be connected to the socket the service was activated from, which is primarily useful for compatibility with daemons designed for use with the traditional [inetd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?inetd(8)) socket activation daemon.\n\nThe ``fd:_`name`_`` option connects standard input to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. The name may be specified as part of this option, following a \"`:`\" character (e.g. \"`fd:foobar`\"). If no name is specified, the name \"`stdin`\" is implied (i.e. \"`fd`\" is equivalent to \"`fd:stdin`\").

If the TTY is used for output only, the executed process will not become the controlling process of the terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to release the terminal.\n\n`journal` connects standard output with the journal, which is accessible via [journalctl(1)](journalctl.html#). Note that everything that is written to kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the specific option listed below is hence a superset of this one. (Also note that any external, additional syslog daemons receive their log data from the journal, too, hence this is the option to use when logging shall be processed with such a daemon.)\n\n`kmsg` connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via [dmesg(1)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html), in addition to the journal. The journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which case this option is no different from `journal`.\n\n`journal+console` and `kmsg+console` work in a similar way as the two options above but copy the output to the system console as well.\n\nThe ``file:_`path`_`` option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard output. The semantics are similar to the same option of `StandardInput=`, see above. If _`path`_ refers to a regular file on the filesystem, it is opened (created if it doesn't exist yet) for writing at the beginning of the file, but without truncating it. If standard input and output are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once, for reading as well as writing and duplicated. This is particularly useful when the specified path refers to an `AF_UNIX` socket in the file system, as in that case only a single stream connection is created for both input and output.\n\n``append:_`path`_`` is similar to ``file:_`path`_`` above, but it opens the file in append mode.\n\n``truncate:_`path`_`` is similar to ``file:_`path`_`` above, but it truncates the file when opening it. For units with multiple command lines, e.g. `Type=oneshot` services with multiple `ExecStart=`, or services with `ExecCondition=`, `ExecStartPre=` or `ExecStartPost=`, the output file is reopened and therefore re-truncated for each command line. If the output file is truncated while another process still has the file open, e.g. by an `ExecReload=` running concurrently with an `ExecStart=`, and the other process continues writing to the file without adjusting its offset, then the space between the file pointers of the two processes may be filled with `NUL` bytes, producing a sparse file. Thus, ``truncate:_`path`_`` is typically only useful for units where only one process runs at a time, such as services with a single `ExecStart=` and no `ExecStartPost=`, `ExecReload=`, `ExecStop=` or similar.\n\n`socket` connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation. The semantics are similar to the same option of `StandardInput=`, see above.\n\nThe ``fd:_`name`_`` option connects standard output to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. A name may be specified as part of this option, following a \"`:`\" character (e.g. \"`fd:foobar`\"). If no name is specified, the name \"`stdout`\" is implied (i.e. \"`fd`\" is equivalent to \"`fd:stdout`\"). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided via the `Sockets=` option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple matches are found, the first one will be used. See `FileDescriptorName=` in [systemd.socket(5)](systemd.socket.html#) for more details about named descriptors and their ordering.\n\nIf the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal or the kernel log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type `After=` on `systemd-journald.socket` (also see the \"Implicit Dependencies\" section above). Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below) will be an `AF_UNIX` stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that can be re-opened. This means when executing shell scripts the construct **echo \"hello\" > /dev/stderr** for writing text to stderr will not work. To mitigate this use the construct **echo \"hello\" >&2** instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall.\n\nThis setting defaults to the value set with `DefaultStandardOutput=` in [systemd-system.conf(5)](systemd-system.conf.html#), which defaults to `journal`.

Use this option to embed process input data directly in the unit file.\n\n`StandardInputText=` accepts arbitrary textual data. C-style escapes for special characters as well as the usual \"`%`\"-specifiers are resolved. Each time this setting is used the specified text is appended to the per-unit data buffer, followed by a newline character (thus every use appends a new line to the end of the buffer). Note that leading and trailing whitespace of lines configured with this option is removed. If an empty line is specified the buffer is cleared (hence, in order to insert an empty line, add an additional \"`\\n`\" to the end or beginning of a line).\n\n`StandardInputData=` accepts arbitrary binary data, encoded in [Base64](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.8). No escape sequences or specifiers are resolved. Any whitespace in the encoded version is ignored during decoding.\n\nNote that `StandardInputText=` and `StandardInputData=` operate on the same data buffer, and may be mixed in order to configure both binary and textual data for the same input stream. The textual or binary data is joined strictly in the order the settings appear in the unit file.

[4,270,"Pass a credential to the unit. Credentials are limited-size binary or textual objects that may be passed to unit processes.

The data is accessible from the unit's processes via the file system, at a read-only location that (if possible and permitted) is backed by non-swappable memory. The data is only accessible to the user associated with the unit, via the `User=`/`DynamicUser=` settings (as well as the superuser). When available, the location of credentials is exported as the `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` environment variable to the unit's processes.\n\nThe `LoadCredential=` setting takes a textual ID to use as name for a credential plus a file system path, separated by a colon. The ID must be a short ASCII string suitable as filename in the filesystem, and may be chosen freely by the user. If the specified path is absolute it is opened as regular file and the credential data is read from it. If the absolute path refers to an `AF_UNIX` stream socket in the file system a connection is made to it (only once at unit start-up) and the credential data read from the connection, providing an easy IPC integration point for dynamically providing credentials from other services. If the specified path is not absolute and itself qualifies as valid credential identifier it is understood to refer to a credential that the service manager itself received via the `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` environment variable, which may be used to propagate credentials from an invoking environment (e.g. a container manager that invoked the service manager) into a service. The contents of the file/socket may be arbitrary binary or textual data, including newline characters and `NUL` bytes. If the file system path is omitted it is chosen identical to the credential name, i.e. this is a terse way do declare credentials to inherit from the service manager into a service. This option may be used multiple times, each time defining an additional credential to pass to the unit.\n\nThe `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` setting is identical to `LoadCredential=`, except that the credential data is decrypted before being passed on to the executed processes. Specifically, the referenced path should refer to a file or socket with an encrypted credential, as implemented by [systemd-creds(1)](systemd-creds.html#). This credential is loaded, decrypted and then passed to the application in decrypted plaintext form, in the same way a regular credential specified via `LoadCredential=` would be. A credential configured this way may encrypted with a secret key derived from the system's TPM2 security chip, or with a secret key stored in `/var/lib/systemd/credentials.secret`, or with both. Using encrypted credentials improves security as credentials are not stored in plaintext and only decrypted into plaintext the moment a service requiring them is started. Moreover, credentials may be bound to the local hardware and installations, so that they cannot easily be analyzed offline.\n\nThe credential files/IPC sockets must be accessible to the service manager, but don't have to be directly accessible to the unit's processes: the credential data is read and copied into separate, read-only copies for the unit that are accessible to appropriately privileged processes. This is particularly useful in combination with `DynamicUser=` as this way privileged data can be made available to processes running under a dynamic UID (i.e. not a previously known one) without having to open up access to all users.\n\nIn order to reference the path a credential may be read from within a `ExecStart=` command line use \"`${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred`\", e.g. \"`ExecStart=cat ${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred`\".\n\nCurrently, an accumulated credential size limit of 1 MB per unit is enforced.\n\nIf referencing an `AF_UNIX` stream socket to connect to, the connection will originate from an abstract namespace socket, that includes information about the unit and the credential ID in its socket name. Use [getpeername(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpeername.2.html) to query this information. The returned socket name is formatted as `NUL` _`RANDOM`_ \"`/unit/`\" _`UNIT`_ \"`/`\" _`ID`_, i.e. a `NUL` byte (as required for abstract namespace socket names), followed by a random string (consisting of alphadecimal characters), followed by the literal string \"`/unit/`\", followed by the requesting unit name, followed by the literal character \"`/`\", followed by the textual credential ID requested. Example: \"`\\0adf9d86b6eda275e/unit/foobar.service/credx`\" in case the credential \"`credx`\" is requested for a unit \"`foobar.service`\". This functionality is useful for using a single listening socket to serve credentials to multiple consumers."],
[4,271,"The `SetCredential=` setting is similar to `LoadCredential=` but accepts a literal value to use as data for the credential, instead of a file system path to read the data from. Do not use this option for data that is supposed to be secret, as it is accessible to unprivileged processes via IPC. It's only safe to use this for user IDs, public key material and similar non-sensitive data. For everything else use `LoadCredential=`. In order to embed binary data into the credential data use C-style escaping (i.e. \"`\\n`\" to embed a newline, or \"`\\x00`\" to embed a `NUL` byte).\n\nThe `SetCredentialEncrypted=` setting is identical to `SetCredential=` but expects an encrypted credential in literal form as value. This allows embedding confidential credentials securely directly in unit files. Use [systemd-creds(1)](systemd-creds.html#)' `-p` switch to generate suitable `SetCredentialEncrypted=` lines directly from plaintext credentials. For further details see `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` above.\n\nIf a credential of the same ID is listed in both `LoadCredential=` and `SetCredential=`, the latter will act as default if the former cannot be retrieved. In this case not being able to retrieve the credential from the path specified in `LoadCredential=` is not considered fatal."],

[4,293,"Configures the process start-up type for this service unit. One of `simple`, `exec`, `forking`, `oneshot`, `dbus`, `notify` or `idle`:\n\n*   If set to `simple` (the default if `ExecStart=` is specified but neither `Type=` nor `BusName=` are), the service manager will consider the unit started immediately after the main service process has been forked off. It is expected that the process configured with `ExecStart=` is the main process of the service. In this mode, if the process offers functionality to other processes on the system, its communication channels should be installed before the service is started up (e.g. sockets set up by systemd, via socket activation), as the service manager will immediately proceed starting follow-up units, right after creating the main service process, and before executing the service's binary. Note that this means **systemctl start** command lines for `simple` services will report success even if the service's binary cannot be invoked successfully (for example because the selected `User=` doesn't exist, or the service binary is missing).\n    \n*   The `exec` type is similar to `simple`, but the service manager will consider the unit started immediately after the main service binary has been executed. The service manager will delay starting of follow-up units until that point. (Or in other words: `simple` proceeds with further jobs right after `fork()` returns, while `exec` will not proceed before both `fork()` and `execve()` in the service process succeeded.) Note that this means **systemctl start** command lines for `exec` services will report failure when the service's binary cannot be invoked successfully (for example because the selected `User=` doesn't exist, or the service binary is missing).\n    \n*   If set to `forking`, it is expected that the process configured with `ExecStart=` will call `fork()` as part of its start-up. The parent process is expected to exit when start-up is complete and all communication channels are set up. The child continues to run as the main service process, and the service manager will consider the unit started when the parent process exits. This is the behavior of traditional UNIX services. If this setting is used, it is recommended to also use the `PIDFile=` option, so that systemd can reliably identify the main process of the service. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units as soon as the parent process exits.\n    \n*   Behavior of `oneshot` is similar to `simple`; however, the service manager will consider the unit up after the main process exits. It will then start follow-up units. `RemainAfterExit=` is particularly useful for this type of service. `Type=``oneshot` is the implied default if neither `Type=` nor `ExecStart=` are specified. Note that if this option is used without `RemainAfterExit=` the service will never enter \"`active`\" unit state, but directly transition from \"`activating`\" to \"`deactivating`\" or \"`dead`\" since no process is configured that shall run continuously. In particular this means that after a service of this type ran (and which has `RemainAfterExit=` not set) it will not show up as started afterwards, but as dead.\n    \n*   Behavior of `dbus` is similar to `simple`; however, it is expected that the service acquires a name on the D-Bus bus, as configured by `BusName=`. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units after the D-Bus bus name has been acquired. Service units with this option configured implicitly gain dependencies on the `dbus.socket` unit. This type is the default if `BusName=` is specified. A service unit of this type is considered to be in the activating state until the specified bus name is acquired. It is considered activated while the bus name is taken. Once the bus name is released the service is considered being no longer functional which has the effect that the service manager attempts to terminate any remaining processes belonging to the service. Services that drop their bus name as part of their shutdown logic thus should be prepared to receive a `SIGTERM` (or whichever signal is configured in `KillSignal=`) as result.\n    \n*   Behavior of `notify` is similar to `exec`; however, it is expected that the service sends a notification message via [sd\\_notify(3)](sd_notify.html#) or an equivalent call when it has finished starting up. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units after this notification message has been sent. If this option is used, `NotifyAccess=` (see below) should be set to open access to the notification socket provided by systemd. If `NotifyAccess=` is missing or set to `none`, it will be forcibly set to `main`.\n    \n*   Behavior of `idle` is very similar to `simple`; however, actual execution of the service program is delayed until all active jobs are dispatched. This may be used to avoid interleaving of output of shell services with the status output on the console. Note that this type is useful only to improve console output, it is not useful as a general unit ordering tool, and the effect of this service type is subject to a 5s timeout, after which the service program is invoked anyway.\n    \n\nIt is generally recommended to use `Type=``simple` for long-running services whenever possible, as it is the simplest and fastest option. However, as this service type won't propagate service start-up failures and doesn't allow ordering of other units against completion of initialization of the service (which for example is useful if clients need to connect to the service through some form of IPC, and the IPC channel is only established by the service itself — in contrast to doing this ahead of time through socket or bus activation or similar), it might not be sufficient for many cases. If so, `notify` or `dbus` (the latter only in case the service provides a D-Bus interface) are the preferred options as they allow service program code to precisely schedule when to consider the service started up successfully and when to proceed with follow-up units. The `notify` service type requires explicit support in the service codebase (as `sd_notify()` or an equivalent API needs to be invoked by the service at the appropriate time) — if it's not supported, then `forking` is an alternative: it supports the traditional UNIX service start-up protocol. Finally, `exec` might be an option for cases where it is enough to ensure the service binary is invoked, and where the service binary itself executes no or little initialization on its own (and its initialization is unlikely to fail). Note that using any type other than `simple` possibly delays the boot process, as the service manager needs to wait for service initialization to complete. It is hence recommended not to needlessly use any types other than `simple`. (Also note it is generally not recommended to use `idle` or `oneshot` for long-running services.)"],
[4,294,"Specifies when the manager should consider the service to be finished. One of `main` or `cgroup`:\n\n*   If set to `main` (the default), the service manager will consider the unit stopped when the main process, which is determined according to the `Type=`, exits. Consequently, it cannot be used with `Type=``oneshot`.\n    \n*   If set to `cgroup`, the service will be considered running as long as at least one process in the cgroup has not exited.\n    \n\nIt is generally recommended to use `ExitType=``main` when a service has a known forking model and a main process can reliably be determined. `ExitType=` `cgroup` is meant for applications whose forking model is not known ahead of time and which might not have a specific main process.

If set to false, DNS lookups are not DNSSEC validated.\n\nNote that DNSSEC validation requires retrieval of additional DNS data, and thus results in a small DNS look-up time penalty.\n\nDNSSEC requires knowledge of \"trust anchors\" to prove data integrity. The trust anchor for the Internet root domain is built into the resolver, additional trust anchors may be defined with [dnssec-trust-anchors.d(5)](dnssec-trust-anchors.d.html#). Trust anchors may change at regular intervals, and old trust anchors may be revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is not possible until new trust anchors are configured locally or the resolver software package is updated with the new root trust anchor. In effect, when the built-in trust anchor is revoked and `DNSSEC=` is true, all further lookups will fail, as it cannot be proved anymore whether lookups are correctly signed, or validly unsigned. If `DNSSEC=` is set to \"`allow-downgrade`\" the resolver will automatically turn off DNSSEC validation in such a case.\n\nClient programs looking up DNS data will be informed whether lookups could be verified using DNSSEC, or whether the returned data could not be verified (either because the data was found unsigned in the DNS, or the DNS server did not support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were known). In the latter case it is assumed that client programs employ a secondary scheme to validate the returned DNS data, should this be required.\n\nIt is recommended to set `DNSSEC=` to true on systems where it is known that the DNS server supports DNSSEC correctly, and where software or trust anchor updates happen regularly. On other systems it is recommended to set `DNSSEC=` to \"`allow-downgrade`\".\n\nIn addition to this global DNSSEC setting [systemd-networkd.service(8)](systemd-networkd.service.html#) also maintains per-link DNSSEC settings. For system DNS servers (see above), only the global DNSSEC setting is in effect. For per-link DNS servers the per-link setting is in effect, unless it is unset in which case the global setting is used instead.\n\nSite-private DNS zones generally conflict with DNSSEC operation, unless a negative (if the private zone is not signed) or positive (if the private zone is signed) trust anchor is configured for them. If \"`allow-downgrade`\" mode is selected, it is attempted to detect site-private DNS zones using top-level domains (TLDs) that are not known by the DNS root server. This logic does not work in all private zone setups.\n\nDefaults to \"`allow-downgrade`\"."],
[4,1427,"Takes a boolean argument or \"`opportunistic`\". If true all connections to the server will be encrypted. Note that this mode requires a DNS server that supports DNS-over-TLS and has a valid certificate. If the hostname was specified in `DNS=` by using the format \"`address#server_name`\" it is used to validate its certificate and also to enable Server Name Indication (SNI) when opening a TLS connection. Otherwise the certificate is checked against the server's IP. If the DNS server does not support DNS-over-TLS all DNS requests will fail.\n\nWhen set to \"`opportunistic`\" DNS request are attempted to send encrypted with DNS-over-TLS. If the DNS server does not support TLS, DNS-over-TLS is disabled. Note that this mode makes DNS-over-TLS vulnerable to \"downgrade\" attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a downgrade to non-encrypted mode by synthesizing a response that suggests DNS-over-TLS was not supported. If set to false, DNS lookups are send over UDP.\n\nNote that DNS-over-TLS requires additional data to be send for setting up an encrypted connection, and thus results in a small DNS look-up time penalty.\n\nNote that in \"`opportunistic`\" mode the resolver is not capable of authenticating the server, so it is vulnerable to \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks.\n\nIn addition to this global `DNSOverTLS=` setting [systemd-networkd.service(8)](systemd-networkd.service.html#) also maintains per-link `DNSOverTLS=` settings. For system DNS servers (see above), only the global `DNSOverTLS=` setting is in effect.

The DNS stub resolver on 127.0.0.54 provides a more limited resolver, that operates in \"proxy\" mode only, i.e. it will pass most DNS messages relatively unmodified to the current upstream DNS servers and back, but not try to process the messages locally, and hence does not validate DNSSEC, or offer up LLMNR/MulticastDNS.

[4,1536,"Takes a boolean argument. If true, the home directory of the user will be suspended automatically during system suspend; if false it will remain active. Automatic suspending of the home directory improves security substantially as secret key material is automatically removed from memory before the system is put to sleep and must be re-acquired (through user re-authentication) when coming back from suspend. It is recommended to set this parameter for all PAM applications that have support for automatically re-authenticating via PAM on system resume. If multiple sessions of the same user are open in parallel the user's home directory will be left unsuspended on system suspend as long as at least one of the sessions does not set this parameter to on. Defaults to off.\n\nNote that TTY logins generally do not support re-authentication on system resume. Re-authentication on system resume is primarily a concept implementable in graphical environments, in the form of lock screens brought up automatically when the system goes to sleep. This means that if a user concurrently uses graphical login sessions that implement the required re-authentication mechanism and console logins that do not, the home directory is not locked during suspend, due to the logic explained above. That said, it is possible to set this field for TTY logins too, ignoring the fact that TTY logins actually don't support the re-authentication mechanism. In that case the TTY sessions will appear hung until the user logs in on another virtual terminal (regardless if via another TTY session or graphically) which will resume the home directory and unblock the original TTY session. (Do note that lack of screen locking on TTY sessions means even though the TTY session appears hung, keypresses can still be queued into it, and the existing screen contents be read without re-authentication; this limitation is unrelated to the home directory management **pam\\_systemd\\_home** and `systemd-homed.service` implement.)\n\nTurning this option on by default is highly recommended for all sessions, but only if the service managing these sessions correctly implements the aforementioned re-authentication. Note that the re-authentication must take place from a component running outside of the user's context, so that it does not require access to the user's home directory for operation. Traditionally, most desktop environments do not implement screen locking this way, and need to be updated accordingly.\n\nThis setting may also be controlled via the `$SYSTEMD_HOME_SUSPEND` environment variable (see below), which **pam\\_systemd\\_home** reads during initialization and sets for sessions.

If set to the special string \"`default`\" the watchdog is opened and pinged in regular intervals, but the timeout is not changed from the default. If set to any other time value the watchdog timeout is configured to the specified value (or a value close to it, depending on hardware capabilities).\n\nIf `RuntimeWatchdogSec=` is set to a non-zero value, the watchdog hardware (`/dev/watchdog0` or the path specified with `WatchdogDevice=` or the kernel option `systemd.watchdog-device=`) will be programmed to automatically reboot the system if it is not contacted within the specified timeout interval. The system manager will ensure to contact it at least once in half the specified timeout interval. This feature requires a hardware watchdog device to be present, as it is commonly the case in embedded and server systems. Not all hardware watchdogs allow configuration of all possible reboot timeout values, in which case the closest available timeout is picked.\n\n`RebootWatchdogSec=` may be used to configure the hardware watchdog when the system is asked to reboot. It works as a safety net to ensure that the reboot takes place even if a clean reboot attempt times out. Note that the `RebootWatchdogSec=` timeout applies only to the second phase of the reboot, i.e. after all regular services are already terminated, and after the system and service manager process (PID 1) got replaced by the `systemd-shutdown` binary, see system [bootup(7)](bootup.html#) for details. During the first phase of the shutdown operation the system and service manager remains running and hence `RuntimeWatchdogSec=` is still honoured. In order to define a timeout on this first phase of system shutdown, configure `JobTimeoutSec=` and `JobTimeoutAction=` in the \\[Unit\\] section of the `shutdown.target` unit. By default `RuntimeWatchdogSec=` defaults to 0 (off), and `RebootWatchdogSec=` to 10min.\n\n`KExecWatchdogSec=` may be used to additionally enable the watchdog when kexec is being executed rather than when rebooting. Note that if the kernel does not reset the watchdog on kexec (depending on the specific hardware and/or driver), in this case the watchdog might not get disabled after kexec succeeds and thus the system might get rebooted, unless `RuntimeWatchdogSec=` is also enabled at the same time. For this reason it is recommended to enable `KExecWatchdogSec=` only if `RuntimeWatchdogSec=` is also enabled.\n\nThese settings have no effect if a hardware watchdog is not available."],

[4,1730,"Takes a path to a regular file, block device node or directory, or the special value \"`auto`\". If specified and the partition is newly created, the data from the specified path is written to the newly created partition, on the block level. If a directory is specified, the backing block device of the file system the directory is on is determined, and the data read directly from that. This option is useful to efficiently replicate existing file systems onto new partitions on the block level — for example to build a simple OS installer or an OS image builder.\n\nIf the special value \"`auto`\" is specified, the source to copy from is automatically picked up from the running system (or the image specified with `--image=` — if used). A partition that matches both the configured partition type (as declared with `Type=` described above), and the currently mounted directory appropriate for that partition type is determined. For example, if the partition type is set to \"`root`\" the partition backing the root directory (`/`) is used as source to copy from — if its partition type is set to \"`root`\" as well. If the declared type is \"`usr`\" the partition backing `/usr/` is used as source to copy blocks from — if its partition type is set to \"`usr`\" too. The logic is capable of automatically tracking down the backing partitions for encrypted and Verity-enabled volumes. \"`CopyBlocks=auto`\" is useful for implementing \"self-replicating\" systems, i.e. systems that are their own installer.\n\nThe file specified here must have a size that is a multiple of the basic block size 512 and not be empty. If this option is used, the size allocation algorithm is slightly altered: the partition is created as least as big as required to fit the data in, i.e. the data size is an additional minimum size value taken into consideration for the allocation algorithm, similar to and in addition to the `SizeMin=` value configured above.\n\nThis option has no effect if the partition it is declared for already exists, i.e. existing data is never overwritten. Note that the data is copied in before the partition table is updated, i.e. before the partition actually is persistently created. This provides robustness: it is guaranteed that the partition either doesn't exist or exists fully populated; it is not possible that the partition exists but is not or only partially populated.\n\nThis option cannot be combined with `Format=` or `CopyFiles=`."],

If `CopyFiles=` is used without `Format=` specified explicitly, \"`Format=`\" with a suitable default is implied (currently \"`ext4`\", but this may change in the future). This option may be used multiple times to copy multiple files or directories from host into the newly formatted file system.

[4,1733,"Takes one or more absolute paths, separated by whitespace, each declaring a directory to create within the new file system. Behaviour is similar to `CopyFiles=`, but instead of copying in a set of files this just creates the specified directories with the default mode of 0755 owned by the root user and group, plus all their parent directories (with the same ownership and access mode). To configure directories with different ownership or access mode, use `CopyFiles=` and specify a source tree to copy containing appropriately owned/configured directories. This option may be used more than once to create multiple directories. When `CopyFiles=` and `MakeDirectories=` are used together the former is applied first. If a directory listed already exists no operation is executed (in particular, the ownership/access mode of the directories is left as is).\n\nThe primary usecase for this option is to create a minimal set of directories that may be mounted over by other partitions contained in the same disk image. For example, a disk image where the root file system is formatted at first boot might want to automatically pre-create `/usr/` in it this way, so that the \"`usr`\" partition may over-mount it.\n\nConsider using [systemd-tmpfiles(8)](systemd-tmpfiles.html#) with its `--image=` option to pre-create other, more complex directory hierarchies (as well as other inodes) with fine-grained control of ownership, access modes and other file attributes."],

With this policy, if the network device name was already set by userspace, the device will not be renamed again. Previously, this naming policy applied implicitly, and now it must be explicitly requested. Effectively, this means that network devices will be renamed according to the configuration, even if they have been renamed already, if `keep` is not specified as the naming policy in the `.link` file.

From now on, for any interface name that would be longer than 15 characters the last 4 characters are set to a 24bit hash value of the full interface name. This way network interface name collisions between multiple similarly named containers (who only differ in container name suffix) should be less likely (but still possible, since the 24bit hash value is very small)."],
