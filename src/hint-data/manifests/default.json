Specifically: failing condition checks (such as `ConditionPathExists=`, `ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=`, … — see below) do not cause the start job of a unit with a `Requires=` dependency on it to fail. Also, some unit types may deactivate on their own (for example, a service process may decide to exit cleanly, or a device may be unplugged by the user), which is not propagated to units having a `Requires=` dependency.

However, this dependency type is stronger: in addition to the effect of `Requires=` it declares that if the unit bound to is stopped, this unit will be stopped too.

Units can suddenly, unexpectedly enter inactive state for different reasons: the main process of a service unit might terminate on its own choice, the backing device of a device unit might be unplugged or the mount point of a mount unit might be unmounted without involvement of the system and service manager.\n\nWhen used in conjunction with `After=` on the same unit the behaviour of `BindsTo=` is even stronger. In this case, the unit bound to strictly has to be in active state for this unit to also be in active state. This not only means a unit bound to another unit that suddenly enters inactive state, but also one that is bound to another unit that gets skipped due to an unmet condition check (such as `ConditionPathExists=`, `ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=`, … — see below) will be stopped, should it be running.

[4,10,"These two settings expect a space-separated list of unit names.

If unit `foo.service` contains the setting `Before=bar.service` and both units are being started, `bar.service`'s start-up is delayed until `foo.service` has finished starting up. `After=` is the inverse of `Before=`, i.e. while `Before=` ensures that the configured unit is started before the listed unit begins starting up, `After=` ensures the opposite, that the listed unit is fully started up before the configured unit is started.\n\nWhen two units with an ordering dependency between them are shut down, the inverse of the start-up order is applied. I.e. if a unit is configured with `After=` on another unit, the former is stopped before the latter if both are shut down. Given two units with any ordering dependency between them, if one unit is shut down and the other is started up, the shutdown is ordered before the start-up. It doesn't matter if the ordering dependency is `After=` or `Before=`, in this case. It also doesn't matter which of the two is shut down, as long as one is shut down and the other is started up; the shutdown is ordered before the start-up in all cases. If two units have no ordering dependencies between them, they are shut down or started up simultaneously, and no ordering takes place. It depends on the unit type when precisely a unit has finished starting up. Most importantly, for service units start-up is considered completed for the purpose of `Before=`/`After=` when all its configured start-up commands have been invoked and they either failed or reported start-up success. Note that this does includes `ExecStartPost=` (or `ExecStopPost=` for the shutdown case).\n\nNote that those settings are independent of and orthogonal to the requirement dependencies as configured by `Requires=`, `Wants=`, `Requisite=`, or `BindsTo=`. It is a common pattern to include a unit name in both the `After=` and `Wants=` options, in which case the unit listed will be started before the unit that is configured with these options.\n\nNote that `Before=` dependencies on device units have no effect and are not supported.

[4,44,"Takes one of `/var/` or `/etc/` as argument, possibly prefixed with a \"`!`\" (to invert the condition). This condition may be used to conditionalize units on whether the specified directory requires an update because `/usr/`'s modification time is newer than the stamp file `.updated` in the specified directory. This is useful to implement offline updates of the vendor operating system resources in `/usr/` that require updating of `/etc/` or `/var/` on the next following boot. Units making use of this condition should order themselves before [systemd-update-done.service(8)](systemd-update-done.service.html), to make sure they run before the stamp file's modification time gets reset indicating a completed update.\n\nIf the `systemd.condition-needs-update=` option is specified on the kernel command line (taking a boolean), it will override the result of this condition check, taking precedence over any file modification time checks. If the kernel command line option is used, `systemd-update-done.service` will not have immediate effect on any following `ConditionNeedsUpdate=` checks, until the system is rebooted where the kernel command line option is not specified anymore.\n\nNote that to make this scheme effective, the timestamp of `/usr/` should be explicitly updated after its contents are modified. The kernel will automatically update modification timestamp on a directory only when immediate children of a directory are modified; an modification of nested files will not automatically result in mtime of `/usr/` being updated.\n\nAlso note that if the update method includes a call to execute appropriate post-update steps itself, it should not touch the timestamp of `/usr/`. In a typical distribution packaging scheme, packages will do any required update steps as part of the installation or upgrade, to make package contents immediately usable. `ConditionNeedsUpdate=` should be used with other update mechanisms where such an immediate update does not happen.\n\nAdded in version 244."],

[4,93,"This setting provides a method for integrating dynamic cgroup, user and group IDs into firewall rules with [NFT](https://netfilter.org/projects/nftables/index.html) sets. The benefit of using this setting is to be able to use the IDs as selectors in firewall rules easily and this in turn allows more fine grained filtering. NFT rules for cgroup matching use numeric cgroup IDs, which change every time a service is restarted, making them hard to use in systemd environment otherwise. Dynamic and random IDs used by `DynamicUser=` can be also integrated with this setting.\n\nThis option expects a whitespace separated list of NFT set definitions.

The names of tables and sets must conform to lexical restrictions of NFT table names. The type of the element used in the NFT filter must match the type implied by the directive (\"`cgroup`\", \"`user`\" or \"`group`\") as shown in the table below. When a control group or a unit is realized, the corresponding ID will be appended to the NFT sets and it will be be removed when the control group or unit is removed. **systemd** only inserts elements to (or removes from) the sets, so the related NFT rules, tables and sets must be prepared elsewhere in advance.

Conversely, the IP filter programs configured for the service are not applied to any sockets passed into the service via socket activation. Thus, it is usually a good idea, to replicate the IP filter programs on both the socket and the service unit, however it often makes sense to maintain one configuration more open and the other one more restricted, depending on the use case.\n\nNote that these settings might not be supported on some systems (for example if eBPF control group support is not enabled in the underlying kernel or container manager).

[4,95,"`BPFProgram=` allows attaching custom BPF programs to the cgroup of a unit. (This generalizes the functionality exposed via `IPEgressFilterPath=` and `IPIngressFilterPath=` for other hooks.) Cgroup-bpf hooks in the form of BPF programs loaded to the BPF filesystem are attached with cgroup-bpf attach flags determined by the unit. For details about attachment types and flags see [`bpf.h`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h). Also refer to the general [BPF documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/).\n\nThe specification of BPF program consists of a pair of BPF program type and program path in the file system, with \"`:`\" as the separator: _`type`_:_`program-path`_.\n\nThe BPF program type is equivalent to the BPF attach type used in [bpftool(8)](https://www.mankier.com/8/bpftool) It may be one of `egress`, `ingress`, `sock_create`, `sock_ops`, `device`, `bind4`, `bind6`, `connect4`, `connect6`, `post_bind4`, `post_bind6`, `sendmsg4`, `sendmsg6`, `sysctl`, `recvmsg4`, `recvmsg6`, `getsockopt`, or `setsockopt`.\n\nThe specified program path must be an absolute path referencing a BPF program inode in the bpffs file system (which generally means it must begin with `/sys/fs/bpf/`). If a specified program does not exist (i.e. has not been uploaded to the BPF subsystem of the kernel yet), it will not be installed but unit activation will continue (a warning will be printed to the logs).\n\nSetting `BPFProgram=` to an empty value makes previous assignments ineffective.\n\nMultiple assignments of the same program type/path pair have the same effect as a single assignment: the program will be attached just once.\n\nIf BPF `egress` pinned to _`program-path`_ path is already being handled by `IPEgressFilterPath=`, `BPFProgram=` assignment will be considered valid and `BPFProgram=` will be attached to a cgroup. Similarly for `ingress` hook and `IPIngressFilterPath=` assignment.\n\nBPF programs passed with `BPFProgram=` are attached to the cgroup of a unit with BPF attach flag `multi`, that allows further attachments of the same _`type`_ within cgroup hierarchy topped by the unit cgroup.\n\nExamples:\n\nBPFProgram=egress:/sys/fs/bpf/egress-hook\nBPFProgram=bind6:/sys/fs/bpf/sock-addr-hook\n\nAdded in version 249."],

Takes two space-separated strings: a device node specifier followed by a combination of `r`, `w`, `m` to control _r_eading, _w_riting, or creation of the specific device nodes by the unit (_m_knod), respectively. This functionality is implemented using eBPF filtering.\n\nWhen access to _all_ physical devices should be disallowed, `PrivateDevices=` may be used instead. See [systemd.exec(5)](systemd.exec.html).\n\nThe device node specifier is either a path to a device node in the file system, starting with `/dev/`, or a string starting with either \"`char-`\" or \"`block-`\" followed by a device group name, as listed in `/proc/devices`. The latter is useful to allow-list all current and future devices belonging to a specific device group at once. The device group is matched according to filename globbing rules, you may hence use the \"`*`\" and \"`?`\" wildcards. (Note that such globbing wildcards are not available for device node path specifications!) In order to match device nodes by numeric major/minor, use device node paths in the `/dev/char/` and `/dev/block/` directories. However, matching devices by major/minor is generally not recommended as assignments are neither stable nor portable between systems or different kernel versions.\n\nExamples: `/dev/sda5` is a path to a device node, referring to an ATA or SCSI block device. \"`char-pts`\" and \"`char-alsa`\" are specifiers for all pseudo TTYs and all ALSA sound devices, respectively. \"`char-cpu/*`\" is a specifier matching all CPU related device groups.\n\nNote that allow lists defined this way should only reference device groups which are resolvable at the time the unit is started. Any device groups not resolvable then are not added to the device allow list. In order to work around this limitation, consider extending service units with a pair of **After=modprobe@xyz.service** and **Wants=modprobe@xyz.service** lines that load the necessary kernel module implementing the device group if missing.

[4,126,"Takes a boolean parameter. If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated dynamically when the unit is started, and released as soon as it is stopped. The user and group will not be added to `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group`, but are managed transiently during runtime. The [nss-systemd(8)](nss-systemd.html) glibc NSS module provides integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system's user and group databases. The user and group name to use may be configured via `User=` and `Group=` (see above). If these options are not used and dynamic user/group allocation is enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly derived from the unit name. If the unit name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is used directly, otherwise a name incorporating a hash of it is used. If a statically allocated user or group of the configured name already exists, it is used and no dynamic user/group is allocated. Note that if `User=` is specified and the static group with the name exists, then it is required that the static user with the name already exists. Similarly, if `Group=` is specified and the static user with the name exists, then it is required that the static group with the name already exists. Dynamic users/groups are allocated from the UID/GID range 61184…65519. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users. At any point in time each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use. However, UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated. Care should be taken that any processes running as part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories. If `DynamicUser=` is enabled, `RemoveIPC=` and `PrivateTmp=` are implied (and cannot be turned off). This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic user/group. Since `/tmp/` and `/var/tmp/` are usually the only world-writable directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination. Furthermore `NoNewPrivileges=` and `RestrictSUIDSGID=` are implicitly enabled (and cannot be disabled), to ensure that processes invoked cannot take benefit or create SUID/SGID files or directories. Moreover `ProtectSystem=strict` and `ProtectHome=read-only` are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they have to be allow-listed using `ReadWritePaths=`, but care must be taken so that UID/GID recycling doesn't create security issues involving files created by the service. Use `RuntimeDirectory=` (see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated. Use `StateDirectory=`, `CacheDirectory=` and `LogsDirectory=` in order to assign a set of writable directories for specific purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse (see below). If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit's processes do not get access to directories outside of these explicitly configured and managed ones. Specifically, do not use `BindPaths=` and be careful with `AF_UNIX` file descriptor passing for directory file descriptors, as this would permit processes to create files or directories owned by the dynamic user/group that are not subject to the lifecycle and access guarantees of the service.

[4,137,"Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See [setrlimit(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setrlimit.2.html) for details on the process resource limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair `soft:hard` to set both limits individually (e.g. \"`LimitAS=4G:16G`\"). Use the string `infinity` to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. \"`LimitAS=16G`\"). For the limits referring to time values, the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see [systemd.time(7)](systemd.time.html) for details). Note that if no time unit is specified for `LimitCPU=` the default unit of seconds is implied, while for `LimitRTTIME=` the default unit of microseconds is implied. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified for `LimitCPU=` will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For `LimitNICE=` the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed with \"`+`\" or \"`-`\", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20…19. If not prefixed like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0…40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).\n\nNote that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set. Also note that `LimitRSS=` is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in [systemd.resource-control(5)](systemd.resource-control.html) over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, `MemoryMax=` is a more powerful (and working) replacement for `LimitRSS=`.\n\nNote that `LimitNPROC=` will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked) by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the `LimitNPROC=` will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations, `TasksMax=` (see [systemd.resource-control(5)](systemd.resource-control.html)) is typically a better choice than `LimitNPROC=`.\n\nResource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various `DefaultLimitCPU=`, `DefaultLimitFSIZE=`, … options available in [systemd-system.conf(5)](systemd-system.conf.html), and – if not configured there – the kernel or per-user defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).\n\nFor system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so. In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager, i.e. the user's instance of `user@.service`. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.\n\n**Table 1. Resource limit directives, their equivalent ulimit shell commands and the unit used**\n\nDirective\n\n**ulimit** equivalent\n\nUnit\n\nNotes\n\nLimitCPU=\n\nulimit -t\n\nSeconds\n\n\\-\n\nLimitFSIZE=\n\nulimit -f\n\nBytes\n\n\\-\n\nLimitDATA=\n\nulimit -d\n\nBytes\n\nDon't use.

Typically applications should increase their soft limit to the hard limit on their own, if they are OK with working with file descriptors above 1023, i.e. do not use [select(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html).

Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour. Both from perspective of the host and from inside the unit, the relevant directories hence always appear directly below `/var/cache`, `/var/log` and `/var/lib`.\n\nUse `RuntimeDirectory=` to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind their lifetime to the daemon runtime. This is particularly useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create runtime directories in `/run/` due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime directory is cleaned up automatically after use.

Paths listed in `ReadOnlyPaths=` are accessible for reading only, writing will be refused even if the usual file access controls would permit this.

Use `ReadWritePaths=` in order to allow-list specific paths for write access if `ProtectSystem=strict` is used. Note that `ReadWritePaths=` cannot be used to gain write access to a file system whose superblock is mounted read-only. On Linux, for each mount point write access is granted only if the mount point itself _and_ the file system superblock backing it are not marked read-only. `ReadWritePaths=` only controls the former, not the latter, hence a read-only file system superblock remains protected.\n\nPaths listed in `InaccessiblePaths=` will be made inaccessible for processes inside the namespace along with everything below them in the file system hierarchy. This may be more restrictive than desired, because it is not possible to nest `ReadWritePaths=`, `ReadOnlyPaths=`, `BindPaths=`, or `BindReadOnlyPaths=` inside it.

This means that this setting may not be used for services which shall be able to install mount points in the main mount namespace. For `ReadWritePaths=` and `ReadOnlyPaths=`, propagation in the other direction is not affected, i.e. mounts created on the host generally appear in the unit processes' namespace, and mounts removed on the host also disappear there too. In particular, note that mount propagation from host to unit will result in unmodified mounts to be created in the unit's namespace, i.e. writable mounts appearing on the host will be writable in the unit's namespace too, even when propagated below a path marked with `ReadOnlyPaths=`! Restricting access with these options hence does not extend to submounts of a directory that are created later on. This means the lock-down offered by that setting is not complete, and does not offer full protection.\n\nNote that the effect of these settings may be undone by privileged processes.

However, the protection can be circumvented, if the service can write to a filesystem, which is not mounted with `noexec` (such as `/dev/shm`), or it can use `memfd_create()`. This can be prevented by making such file systems inaccessible to the service (e.g. `InaccessiblePaths=/dev/shm`) and installing further system call filters (`SystemCallFilter=~memfd_create`). Note that this feature is fully available on x86-64, and partially on x86. Specifically, the `shmat()` protection is not available on x86. Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this option.

This means any file system mount points established or removed by the unit's processes will be private to them and not be visible to the host. However, file system mount points established or removed on the host will be propagated to the unit's processes. See [mount\\_namespaces(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html) for details on file system namespaces.

Finally, the mounts are remounted again to the propagation mode configured with `MountFlags=`, see below.\n\nFile system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager. Mounts established in the namespace of the process created by `ExecStartPre=` will hence be cleaned up automatically as soon as that process exits and will not be available to subsequent processes forked off for `ExecStart=` (and similar applies to the various other commands configured for units).

If this setting is used, all system calls executed by the unit processes except for the listed ones will result in immediate process termination with the `SIGSYS` signal (allow-listing).

If the first character of the list is \"`~`\", the effect is inverted: only the listed system calls will result in immediate process termination (deny-listing). Deny-listed system calls and system call groups may optionally be suffixed with a colon (\"`:`\") and \"`errno`\" error number (between 0 and 4095) or errno name such as `EPERM`, `EACCES` or `EUCLEAN` (see [errno(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html) for a full list). This value will be returned when a deny-listed system call is triggered, instead of terminating the processes immediately. Special setting \"`kill`\" can be used to explicitly specify killing.

Specifically, access to the `execve()` system call is required for the execution of the service binary — if it is blocked service invocation will necessarily fail. Also, if execution of the service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error handling logic might require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly. It might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such failures.\n\nIf you specify both types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered will take precedence and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a system call). Then the next occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed system calls from the set of the filtered system calls, depending of its type and the default action.

calls used by common system services, excluding any special purpose calls. This is the recommended starting point for allow-listing system calls for system services, as it contains what is typically needed by system services, but excludes overly specific interfaces. For example, the following APIs are excluded: \"`@clock`\", \"`@mount`\", \"`@swap`\", \"`@reboot`\".\n\n@timer\n\nSystem calls for scheduling operations by time ([alarm(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/alarm.2.html), [timer\\_create(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timer_create.2.html), …)\n\n@known\n\nAll system calls defined by the kernel. This list is defined statically in systemd based on a kernel version that was available when this systemd version was released. It will become progressively more out-of-date as the kernel is updated.\n\n  \nNote, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be added to the groups above. Contents of the sets may also change between systemd versions. In addition, the list of system calls depends on the kernel version and architecture for which systemd was compiled. Use **systemd-analyze syscall-filter** to list the actual list of system calls in each filter.\n\nGenerally, allow-listing system calls (rather than deny-listing) is the safer mode of operation. It is recommended to enforce system call allow lists for all long-running system services. Specifically, the following lines are a relatively safe basic choice for the majority of system services:\n\n\\[Service\\]\nSystemCallFilter=@system-service\nSystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM\n\nNote that various kernel system calls are defined redundantly: there are multiple system calls for executing the same operation. For example, the `pidfd_send_signal()` system call may be used to execute operations similar to what can be done with the older `kill()` system call, hence blocking the latter without the former only provides weak protection. Since new system calls are added regularly to the kernel as development progresses, keeping system call deny lists comprehensive requires constant work. It is thus recommended to use allow-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system calls are by default implicitly blocked until the allow list is updated.\n\nAlso note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to work. The dynamic linker is required for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF binaries, which is how most distributions build packaged programs). This means that blocking these system calls (which include `open()`, `openat()` or `mmap()`) will make most programs typically shipped with generic distributions unusable.\n\nIt is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with `SystemCallFilter=~@mount`, in order to prohibit the unit's processes to undo the mappings. Specifically these are the options `PrivateTmp=`, `PrivateDevices=`, `ProtectSystem=`, `ProtectHome=`, `ProtectKernelTunables=`, `ProtectControlGroups=`, `ProtectKernelLogs=`, `ProtectClock=`, `ReadOnlyPaths=`, `InaccessiblePaths=` and `ReadWritePaths=`.\n\nAdded in version 187."],

See [errno(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html) for a full list of error codes.

[4,188,"Takes a space-separated list of architecture identifiers to include in the system call filter. The known architecture identifiers are the same as for `ConditionArchitecture=` described in [systemd.unit(5)](systemd.unit.html), as well as `x32`, `mips64-n32`, `mips64-le-n32`, and the special identifier `native`. The special identifier `native` implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more precisely: to the architecture the system manager is compiled for). By default, this option is set to the empty list, i.e. no filtering is applied.\n\nIf this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and system calls of the specified architectures. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated as including x86-64 system calls. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on x32.\n\nSystem call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures. For example, on x86 filtering of network socket-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations — a limitation that x86-64 does not have, however. On systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time — such as x86/x86-64 — it is hence recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary ABIs may not be used to circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system. In particular, setting `SystemCallArchitectures=native` is a good choice for disabling non-native ABIs.\n\nSystem call architectures may also be restricted system-wide via the `SystemCallArchitectures=` option in the global configuration.

If the terminal is already being controlled by another process, the executed process waits until the current controlling process releases the terminal.\n\n`tty-force` is similar to `tty`, but the executed process is forcefully and immediately made the controlling process of the terminal, potentially removing previous controlling processes from the terminal.\n\n`tty-fail` is similar to `tty`, but if the terminal already has a controlling process start-up of the executed process fails.\n\nThe `data` option may be used to configure arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via standard input to the executed process. The data to pass is configured via `StandardInputText=`/`StandardInputData=` (see below). Note that the actual file descriptor type passed (memory file, regular file, UNIX pipe, …) might depend on the kernel and available privileges. In any case, the file descriptor is read-only, and when read returns the specified data followed by EOF.\n\nThe ``file:_`path`_`` option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard input. An absolute path following the \"`:`\" character is expected, which may refer to a regular file, a FIFO or special file. If an `AF_UNIX` socket in the file system is specified, a stream socket is connected to it. The latter is useful for connecting standard input of processes to arbitrary system services.\n\nThe `socket` option is valid in socket-activated services only, and requires the relevant socket unit file (see [systemd.socket(5)](systemd.socket.html) for details) to have `Accept=yes` set, or to specify a single socket only. If this option is set, standard input will be connected to the socket the service was activated from, which is primarily useful for compatibility with daemons designed for use with the traditional [inetd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?inetd(8)) socket activation daemon (`$LISTEN_FDS` (and related) environment variables are not passed when `socket` value is configured).\n\nThe ``fd:_`name`_`` option connects standard input to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. The name may be specified as part of this option, following a \"`:`\" character (e.g. \"`fd:foobar`\"). If no name is specified, the name \"`stdin`\" is implied (i.e. \"`fd`\" is equivalent to \"`fd:stdin`\"). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided via the `Sockets=` option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit.

If the TTY is used for output only, the executed process will not become the controlling process of the terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to release the terminal.\n\n`journal` connects standard output with the journal, which is accessible via [journalctl(1)](journalctl.html). Note that everything that is written to kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the specific option listed below is hence a superset of this one. (Also note that any external, additional syslog daemons receive their log data from the journal, too, hence this is the option to use when logging shall be processed with such a daemon.)\n\n`kmsg` connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via [dmesg(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html), in addition to the journal. The journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which case this option is no different from `journal`.\n\n`journal+console` and `kmsg+console` work in a similar way as the two options above but copy the output to the system console as well.\n\nThe ``file:_`path`_`` option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard output. The semantics are similar to the same option of `StandardInput=`, see above. If _`path`_ refers to a regular file on the filesystem, it is opened (created if it doesn't exist yet) for writing at the beginning of the file, but without truncating it. If standard input and output are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once — for reading as well as writing — and duplicated. This is particularly useful when the specified path refers to an `AF_UNIX` socket in the file system, as in that case only a single stream connection is created for both input and output.\n\n``append:_`path`_`` is similar to ``file:_`path`_`` above, but it opens the file in append mode.\n\n``truncate:_`path`_`` is similar to ``file:_`path`_`` above, but it truncates the file when opening it. For units with multiple command lines, e.g. `Type=oneshot` services with multiple `ExecStart=`, or services with `ExecCondition=`, `ExecStartPre=` or `ExecStartPost=`, the output file is reopened and therefore re-truncated for each command line. If the output file is truncated while another process still has the file open, e.g. by an `ExecReload=` running concurrently with an `ExecStart=`, and the other process continues writing to the file without adjusting its offset, then the space between the file pointers of the two processes may be filled with `NUL` bytes, producing a sparse file. Thus, ``truncate:_`path`_`` is typically only useful for units where only one process runs at a time, such as services with a single `ExecStart=` and no `ExecStartPost=`, `ExecReload=`, `ExecStop=` or similar.\n\n`socket` connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation. The semantics are similar to the same option of `StandardInput=`, see above.\n\nThe ``fd:_`name`_`` option connects standard output to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. A name may be specified as part of this option, following a \"`:`\" character (e.g. \"``fd:_`foobar`_``\"). If no name is specified, the name \"`stdout`\" is implied (i.e. \"`fd`\" is equivalent to \"`fd:stdout`\"). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided via the `Sockets=` option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple matches are found, the first one will be used. See `FileDescriptorName=` in [systemd.socket(5)](systemd.socket.html) for more details about named descriptors and their ordering.\n\nIf the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal or the kernel log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type `After=` on `systemd-journald.socket` (also see the \"Implicit Dependencies\" section above). Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below) will be an `AF_UNIX` stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that can be re-opened. This means when executing shell scripts the construct **echo \"hello\" > /dev/stderr** for writing text to stderr will not work. To mitigate this use the construct **echo \"hello\" >&2** instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall.\n\nIf `StandardInput=` is set to one of `tty`, `tty-force`, `tty-fail`, `socket`, or ``fd:_`name`_``, this setting defaults to `inherit`.\n\nIn other cases, this setting defaults to the value set with `DefaultStandardOutput=` in [systemd-system.conf(5)](systemd-system.conf.html), which defaults to `journal`.

These settings have no effect unless `StandardInput=` is set to `data` (which is the default if `StandardInput=` is not set otherwise, but `StandardInputText=`/`StandardInputData=` is). Use this option to embed process input data directly in the unit file.\n\n`StandardInputText=` accepts arbitrary textual data. C-style escapes for special characters as well as the usual \"`%`\"-specifiers are resolved. Each time this setting is used the specified text is appended to the per-unit data buffer, followed by a newline character (thus every use appends a new line to the end of the buffer). Note that leading and trailing whitespace of lines configured with this option is removed. If an empty line is specified the buffer is cleared (hence, in order to insert an empty line, add an additional \"`\\n`\" to the end or beginning of a line).\n\n`StandardInputData=` accepts arbitrary binary data, encoded in [Base64](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.8). No escape sequences or specifiers are resolved. Any whitespace in the encoded version is ignored during decoding.\n\nNote that `StandardInputText=` and `StandardInputData=` operate on the same data buffer, and may be mixed in order to configure both binary and textual data for the same input stream. The textual or binary data is joined strictly in the order the settings appear in the unit file.

See [syslog(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html) for details. By default no filtering is applied (i.e. the default maximum log level is `debug`). Use this option to configure the logging system to drop log messages of a specific service above the specified level.

Note that the configured level is applied to any log messages written by any of the processes belonging to this unit, as well as any log messages written by the system manager process (PID 1) in reference to this unit, sent via any supported logging protocol. The filtering is applied early in the logging pipeline, before any kind of further processing is done. Moreover, messages which pass through this filter successfully might still be dropped by filters applied at a later stage in the logging subsystem.

[4,212,"Pass a credential to the unit. Credentials are limited-size binary or textual objects that may be passed to unit processes. They are primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both public and private) or certificates, user account information or identity information from host to services. The data is accessible from the unit's processes via the file system, at a read-only location that (if possible and permitted) is backed by non-swappable memory. The data is only accessible to the user associated with the unit, via the `User=`/`DynamicUser=` settings (as well as the superuser). When available, the location of credentials is exported as the `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` environment variable to the unit's processes.\n\nThe `LoadCredential=` setting takes a textual ID to use as name for a credential plus a file system path, separated by a colon. The ID must be a short ASCII string suitable as filename in the filesystem, and may be chosen freely by the user. If the specified path is absolute it is opened as regular file and the credential data is read from it. If the absolute path refers to an `AF_UNIX` stream socket in the file system a connection is made to it (only once at unit start-up) and the credential data read from the connection, providing an easy IPC integration point for dynamically transferring credentials from other services.\n\nIf the specified path is not absolute and itself qualifies as valid credential identifier it is attempted to find a credential that the service manager itself received under the specified name — which may be used to propagate credentials from an invoking environment (e.g. a container manager that invoked the service manager) into a service. If no matching system credential is found, the directories `/etc/credstore/`, `/run/credstore/` and `/usr/lib/credstore/` are searched for files under the credential's name — which hence are recommended locations for credential data on disk. If `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` is used `/run/credstore.encrypted/`, `/etc/credstore.encrypted/`, and `/usr/lib/credstore.encrypted/` are searched as well.\n\nIf the file system path is omitted it is chosen identical to the credential name, i.e. this is a terse way to declare credentials to inherit from the service manager into a service. This option may be used multiple times, each time defining an additional credential to pass to the unit.\n\nIf an absolute path referring to a directory is specified, every file in that directory (recursively) will be loaded as a separate credential. The ID for each credential will be the provided ID suffixed with \"`_$FILENAME`\" (e.g., \"`Key_file1`\"). When loading from a directory, symlinks will be ignored.\n\nThe contents of the file/socket may be arbitrary binary or textual data, including newline characters and `NUL` bytes.\n\nThe `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` setting is identical to `LoadCredential=`, except that the credential data is decrypted and authenticated before being passed on to the executed processes. Specifically, the referenced path should refer to a file or socket with an encrypted credential, as implemented by [systemd-creds(1)](systemd-creds.html). This credential is loaded, decrypted, authenticated and then passed to the application in plaintext form, in the same way a regular credential specified via `LoadCredential=` would be. A credential configured this way may be symmetrically encrypted/authenticated with a secret key derived from the system's TPM2 security chip, or with a secret key stored in `/var/lib/systemd/credentials.secret`, or with both. Using encrypted and authenticated credentials improves security as credentials are not stored in plaintext and only authenticated and decrypted into plaintext the moment a service requiring them is started. Moreover, credentials may be bound to the local hardware and installations, so that they cannot easily be analyzed offline, or be generated externally. When `DevicePolicy=` is set to \"`closed`\" or \"`strict`\", or set to \"`auto`\" and `DeviceAllow=` is set, or `PrivateDevices=` is set, then this setting adds `/dev/tpmrm0` with `rw` mode to `DeviceAllow=`. See [systemd.resource-control(5)](systemd.resource-control.html) for the details about `DevicePolicy=` or `DeviceAllow=`.\n\nThe credential files/IPC sockets must be accessible to the service manager, but don't have to be directly accessible to the unit's processes: the credential data is read and copied into separate, read-only copies for the unit that are accessible to appropriately privileged processes. This is particularly useful in combination with `DynamicUser=` as this way privileged data can be made available to processes running under a dynamic UID (i.e. not a previously known one) without having to open up access to all users.\n\nIn order to reference the path a credential may be read from within a `ExecStart=` command line use \"`${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred`\", e.g. \"`ExecStart=cat ${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred`\". In order to reference the path a credential may be read from within a `Environment=` line use \"`%d/mycred`\", e.g. \"`Environment=MYCREDPATH=%d/mycred`\". For system services the path may also be referenced as \"``/run/credentials/_`UNITNAME`_``\" in cases where no interpolation is possible, e.g. configuration files of software that does not yet support credentials natively. `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` is considered the primary interface to look for credentials, though, since it also works for user services.\n\nCurrently, an accumulated credential size limit of 1 MB per unit is enforced.\n\nThe service manager itself may receive system credentials that can be propagated to services from a hosting container manager or VM hypervisor. See the [Container Interface](https://systemd.io/CONTAINER_INTERFACE) documentation for details about the former. For the latter, pass [DMI/SMBIOS](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios) OEM string table entries (field type 11) with a prefix of \"`io.systemd.credential:`\" or \"`io.systemd.credential.binary:`\". In both cases a key/value pair separated by \"`=`\" is expected, in the latter case the right-hand side is Base64 decoded when parsed (thus permitting binary data to be passed in). Example [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/index.html) switch: \"`-smbios type=11,value=io.systemd.credential:xx=yy`\", or \"`-smbios type=11,value=io.systemd.credential.binary:rick=TmV2ZXIgR29ubmEgR2l2ZSBZb3UgVXA=`\". Alternatively, use the **qemu** \"`fw_cfg`\" node \"`opt/io.systemd.credentials/`\". Example **qemu** switch: \"`-fw_cfg name=opt/io.systemd.credentials/mycred,string=supersecret`\". They may also be passed from the UEFI firmware environment via [systemd-stub(7)](systemd-stub.html), from the initrd (see [systemd(1)](systemd.html)), or be specified on the kernel command line using the \"`systemd.set_credential=`\" and \"`systemd.set_credential_binary=`\" switches (see [systemd(1)](systemd.html) – this is not recommended since unprivileged userspace can read the kernel command line).\n\nIf referencing an `AF_UNIX` stream socket to connect to, the connection will originate from an abstract namespace socket, that includes information about the unit and the credential ID in its socket name. Use [getpeername(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpeername.2.html) to query this information. The returned socket name is formatted as `NUL` _`RANDOM`_ \"`/unit/`\" _`UNIT`_ \"`/`\" _`ID`_, i.e. a `NUL` byte (as required for abstract namespace socket names), followed by a random string (consisting of alphadecimal characters), followed by the literal string \"`/unit/`\", followed by the requesting unit name, followed by the literal character \"`/`\", followed by the textual credential ID requested. Example: \"`\\0adf9d86b6eda275e/unit/foobar.service/credx`\" in case the credential \"`credx`\" is requested for a unit \"`foobar.service`\". This functionality is useful for using a single listening socket to serve credentials to multiple consumers.\n\nFor further information see [System and Service Credentials](https://systemd.io/CREDENTIALS) documentation.\n\nAdded in version 247."],

Takes a credential name for which we'll attempt to find a credential that the service manager itself received under the specified name — which may be used to propagate credentials from an invoking environment (e.g. a container manager that invoked the service manager) into a service. If the credential name is a glob, all credentials matching the glob are passed to the unit. Matching credentials are searched for in the system credentials, the encrypted system credentials, and under `/etc/credstore/`, `/run/credstore/`, `/usr/lib/credstore/`, `/run/credstore.encrypted/`, `/etc/credstore.encrypted/`, and `/usr/lib/credstore.encrypted/` in that order.

Do not use this option for data that is supposed to be secret, as it is accessible to unprivileged processes via IPC. It's only safe to use this for user IDs, public key material and similar non-sensitive data. For everything else use `LoadCredential=`. In order to embed binary data into the credential data use C-style escaping (i.e. \"`\\n`\" to embed a newline, or \"`\\x00`\" to embed a `NUL` byte).\n\nThe `SetCredentialEncrypted=` setting is identical to `SetCredential=` but expects an encrypted credential in literal form as value. This allows embedding confidential credentials securely directly in unit files. Use [systemd-creds(1)](systemd-creds.html)' `-p` switch to generate suitable `SetCredentialEncrypted=` lines directly from plaintext credentials. For further details see `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` above.\n\nWhen multiple credentials of the same name are found, credentials found by `LoadCredential=`, `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` and `ImportCredential=` take priority over credentials found by `SetCredential=`. As such, `SetCredential=` will act as default if no credentials are found by any of the former.

This service changes the mount table before transitioning to the host system, so that a volatile memory file system (\"`tmpfs`\") is used as root directory, with only `/usr/` mounted into it from the configured root file system, in read-only mode.

The main distinction between `systemd.volatile=yes`, and `root=tmpfs` in combination `mount.usr=` is that the former operates on top of a regular root file system and temporarily obstructs the files and directories above its `/usr/` subdirectory, while the latter does not hide any files, but simply mounts a unpopulated tmpfs as root file system and combines it with a user picked `/usr/` file system.\n\nAdded in version 233."],

The trust anchor for the Internet root domain is built into the resolver, additional trust anchors may be defined with [dnssec-trust-anchors.d(5)](dnssec-trust-anchors.d.html). Trust anchors may change at regular intervals, and old trust anchors may be revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is not possible until new trust anchors are configured locally or the resolver software package is updated with the new root trust anchor.

If `DNSSEC=` is set to \"`allow-downgrade`\" the resolver will automatically turn off DNSSEC validation in such a case.\n\nClient programs looking up DNS data will be informed whether lookups could be verified using DNSSEC, or whether the returned data could not be verified (either because the data was found unsigned in the DNS, or the DNS server did not support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were known). In the latter case it is assumed that client programs employ a secondary scheme to validate the returned DNS data, should this be required.\n\nIt is recommended to set `DNSSEC=` to true on systems where it is known that the DNS server supports DNSSEC correctly, and where software or trust anchor updates happen regularly.

[4,465,"Takes a boolean argument. If true, the home directory of the user will be suspended automatically during system suspend; if false it will remain active. Automatic suspending of the home directory improves security substantially as secret key material is automatically removed from memory before the system is put to sleep and must be re-acquired (through user re-authentication) when coming back from suspend. It is recommended to set this parameter for all PAM applications that have support for automatically re-authenticating via PAM on system resume. If multiple sessions of the same user are open in parallel the user's home directory will be left unsuspended on system suspend as long as at least one of the sessions does not set this parameter to on. Defaults to off.\n\nNote that TTY logins generally do not support re-authentication on system resume. Re-authentication on system resume is primarily a concept implementable in graphical environments, in the form of lock screens brought up automatically when the system goes to sleep. This means that if a user concurrently uses graphical login sessions that implement the required re-authentication mechanism and console logins that do not, the home directory is not locked during suspend, due to the logic explained above. That said, it is possible to set this field for TTY logins too, ignoring the fact that TTY logins actually don't support the re-authentication mechanism. In that case the TTY sessions will appear hung until the user logs in on another virtual terminal (regardless if via another TTY session or graphically) which will resume the home directory and unblock the original TTY session. (Do note that lack of screen locking on TTY sessions means even though the TTY session appears hung, keypresses can still be queued into it, and the existing screen contents be read without re-authentication; this limitation is unrelated to the home directory management **pam\\_systemd\\_home** and `systemd-homed.service` implement.)\n\nTurning this option on by default is highly recommended for all sessions, but only if the service managing these sessions correctly implements the aforementioned re-authentication. Note that the re-authentication must take place from a component running outside of the user's context, so that it does not require access to the user's home directory for operation. Traditionally, most desktop environments do not implement screen locking this way, and need to be updated accordingly.\n\nThis setting may also be controlled via the `$SYSTEMD_HOME_SUSPEND` environment variable (see below), which **pam\\_systemd\\_home** reads during initialization and sets for sessions. If both the environment variable is set and the module parameter specified the latter takes precedence.\n\nAdded in version 245."],

Neither the seed key nor the primary key are permitted to ever leave the TPM2 chip — however, the now encrypted randomized key may. It is saved in the LUKS2 volume JSON token header. When unlocking the encrypted volume, the primary key pair is generated on the TPM2 chip again (which works as long as the chip's seed key is correctly maintained by the TPM2 chip), which is then used to decrypt (on the TPM2 chip) the encrypted key from the LUKS2 volume JSON token header saved there during enrollment. The resulting decrypted key is then used to unlock the volume.

If a directory is specified, the backing block device of the file system the directory is on is determined, and the data read directly from that. This option is useful to efficiently replicate existing file systems onto new partitions on the block level — for example to build a simple OS installer or an OS image builder.\n\nIf the special value \"`auto`\" is specified, the source to copy from is automatically picked up from the running system (or the image specified with `--image=` — if used). A partition that matches both the configured partition type (as declared with `Type=` described above), and the currently mounted directory appropriate for that partition type is determined.

If the declared type is \"`usr`\" the partition backing `/usr/` is used as source to copy blocks from — if its partition type is set to \"`usr`\" too.

This option may be used multiple times to copy multiple files or directories from host into the newly formatted file system. The colon and second path may be omitted in which case the source path is also used as the target path (relative to the root of the newly created file system). If the source path refers to a directory it is copied recursively.\n\nThis option has no effect if the partition already exists: it cannot be used to copy additional files into an existing partition, it may only be used to populate a file system created anew.\n\nThe copy operation is executed before the file system is registered in the partition table, thus ensuring that a file system populated this way only ever exists fully initialized.\n\nNote that `CopyFiles=` will skip copying files that aren't supported by the target filesystem (e.g symlinks, fifos, sockets and devices on vfat).

The port name _`port_name`_ is used, or the port number `d`_`dev_port`_ if the name is not known.\n\nFor BCMA devices, the core number is suppressed when 0.\n\nFor USB devices the full chain of port numbers of hubs is composed. If the name gets longer than the maximum number of 15 characters, the name is not exported. The usual USB configuration number 1 and interface number 0 values are suppressed.\n\nSR-IOV virtual devices are named based on the name of the parent interface, with a suffix of `v` and the virtual device number, with any leading zeros removed. The bus number is ignored.\n\nSR-IOV virtual device representors are named based on the name of the physical device interface, with a suffix of `r` and the number of the virtual device that is linked to the particular representor, with any leading zeros removed. The physical port name and the bus number are ignored.\n\nIn some configurations a parent PCI bridge of a given network controller may be associated with a slot. In such case we don't generate this device property to avoid possible naming conflicts.\n\nAdded in version 243."],
