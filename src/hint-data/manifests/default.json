[4,72,"Takes a boolean argument. If true, the home directory of the user will be suspended automatically during system suspend; if false it will remain active. Automatic suspending of the home directory improves security substantially as secret key material is automatically removed from memory before the system is put to sleep and must be re-acquired (through user re-authentication) when coming back from suspend. It is recommended to set this parameter for all PAM applications that have support for automatically re-authenticating via PAM on system resume. If multiple sessions of the same user are open in parallel the user's home directory will be left unsuspended on system suspend as long as at least one of the sessions does not set this parameter to on. Defaults to off.\n\nNote that TTY logins generally do not support re-authentication on system resume. Re-authentication on system resume is primarily a concept implementable in graphical environments, in the form of lock screens brought up automatically when the system goes to sleep. This means that if a user concurrently uses graphical login sessions that implement the required re-authentication mechanism and console logins that do not, the home directory is not locked during suspend, due to the logic explained above. That said, it is possible to set this field for TTY logins too, ignoring the fact that TTY logins actually don't support the re-authentication mechanism. In that case the TTY sessions will appear hung until the user logs in on another virtual terminal (regardless if via another TTY session or graphically) which will resume the home directory and unblock the original TTY session. (Do note that lack of screen locking on TTY sessions means even though the TTY session appears hung, keypresses can still be queued into it, and the existing screen contents be read without re-authentication; this limitation is unrelated to the home directory management **pam\\_systemd\\_home** and `systemd-homed.service` implement.)\n\nTurning this option on by default is highly recommended for all sessions, but only if the service managing these sessions correctly implements the aforementioned re-authentication. Note that the re-authentication must take place from a component running outside of the user's context, so that it does not require access to the user's home directory for operation. Traditionally, most desktop environments do not implement screen locking this way, and need to be updated accordingly.\n\nThis setting may also be controlled via the `$SYSTEMD_HOME_SUSPEND` environment variable (see below), which **pam\\_systemd\\_home** reads during initialization and sets for sessions.

Note that this mode makes DNSSEC validation vulnerable to \"downgrade\" attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a downgrade to non-DNSSEC mode by synthesizing a DNS response that suggests DNSSEC was not supported.\n\nIf set to false, DNS lookups are not DNSSEC validated. In this mode, or when set to \"`allow-downgrade`\" and the downgrade has happened, the resolver becomes security-unaware and all forwarded queries have DNSSEC OK (DO) bit unset.\n\nNote that DNSSEC validation requires retrieval of additional DNS data, and thus results in a small DNS lookup time penalty.\n\nDNSSEC requires knowledge of \"trust anchors\" to prove data integrity. The trust anchor for the Internet root domain is built into the resolver, additional trust anchors may be defined with [dnssec-trust-anchors.d(5)](dnssec-trust-anchors.d.html). Trust anchors may change at regular intervals, and old trust anchors may be revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is not possible until new trust anchors are configured locally or the resolver software package is updated with the new root trust anchor. In effect, when the built-in trust anchor is revoked and `DNSSEC=` is true, all further lookups will fail, as it cannot be proved anymore whether lookups are correctly signed, or validly unsigned. If `DNSSEC=` is set to \"`allow-downgrade`\" the resolver will automatically turn off DNSSEC validation in such a case.\n\nClient programs looking up DNS data will be informed whether lookups could be verified using DNSSEC, or whether the returned data could not be verified (either because the data was found unsigned in the DNS, or the DNS server did not support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were known). In the latter case it is assumed that client programs employ a secondary scheme to validate the returned DNS data, should this be required.\n\nIt is recommended to set `DNSSEC=` to true on systems where it is known that the DNS server supports DNSSEC correctly, and where software or trust anchor updates happen regularly. On other systems it is recommended to set `DNSSEC=` to \"`allow-downgrade`\".\n\nIn addition to this global DNSSEC setting [systemd-networkd.service(8)](systemd-networkd.service.html) also maintains per-link DNSSEC settings. For system DNS servers (see above), only the global DNSSEC setting is in effect. For per-link DNS servers the per-link setting is in effect, unless it is unset in which case the global setting is used instead.\n\nSite-private DNS zones generally conflict with DNSSEC operation, unless a negative (if the private zone is not signed) or positive (if the private zone is signed) trust anchor is configured for them. If \"`allow-downgrade`\" mode is selected, it is attempted to detect site-private DNS zones using top-level domains (TLDs) that are not known by the DNS root server. This logic does not work in all private zone setups.\n\nDefaults to \"`allow-downgrade`\".","#DNSSEC=",229],
[4,89,"Takes a boolean argument or \"`opportunistic`\". If true all connections to the server will be encrypted. Note that this mode requires a DNS server that supports DNS-over-TLS and has a valid certificate. If the hostname was specified in `DNS=` by using the format \"`address#server_name`\" it is used to validate its certificate and also to enable Server Name Indication (SNI) when opening a TLS connection. Otherwise the certificate is checked against the server's IP. If the DNS server does not support DNS-over-TLS all DNS requests will fail.\n\nWhen set to \"`opportunistic`\" DNS request are attempted to send encrypted with DNS-over-TLS. If the DNS server does not support TLS, DNS-over-TLS is disabled. Note that this mode makes DNS-over-TLS vulnerable to \"downgrade\" attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a downgrade to non-encrypted mode by synthesizing a response that suggests DNS-over-TLS was not supported. If set to false, DNS lookups are send over UDP.\n\nNote that DNS-over-TLS requires additional data to be send for setting up an encrypted connection, and thus results in a small DNS look-up time penalty.\n\nNote that in \"`opportunistic`\" mode the resolver is not capable of authenticating the server, so it is vulnerable to \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks.\n\nIn addition to this global `DNSOverTLS=` setting [systemd-networkd.service(8)](systemd-networkd.service.html) also maintains per-link `DNSOverTLS=` settings.

The DNS stub resolver on 127.0.0.54 provides a more limited resolver, that operates in \"proxy\" mode only, i.e. it will pass most DNS messages relatively unmodified to the current upstream DNS servers and back, but not try to process the messages locally, and hence does not validate DNSSEC, or offer up LLMNR/MulticastDNS.

The user and group will not be added to `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group`, but are managed transiently during runtime. The [nss-systemd(8)](nss-systemd.html) glibc NSS module provides integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system's user and group databases. The user and group name to use may be configured via `User=` and `Group=` (see above). If these options are not used and dynamic user/group allocation is enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly derived from the unit name. If the unit name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is used directly, otherwise a name incorporating a hash of it is used. If a statically allocated user or group of the configured name already exists, it is used and no dynamic user/group is allocated. Note that if `User=` is specified and the static group with the name exists, then it is required that the static user with the name already exists. Similarly, if `Group=` is specified and the static user with the name exists, then it is required that the static group with the name already exists. Dynamic users/groups are allocated from the UID/GID range 61184…65519. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system or login users. At any point in time each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to zero or one dynamically allocated users/groups in use. However, UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated. Care should be taken that any processes running as part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories. If `DynamicUser=` is enabled, `RemoveIPC=` and `PrivateTmp=` are implied (and cannot be turned off). This ensures that the lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed processes is bound to the runtime of the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic user/group. Since `/tmp/` and `/var/tmp/` are usually the only world-writable directories on a system this ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group allocation cannot leave files around after unit termination. Furthermore `NoNewPrivileges=` and `RestrictSUIDSGID=` are implicitly enabled (and cannot be disabled), to ensure that processes invoked cannot take benefit or create SUID/SGID files or directories. Moreover `ProtectSystem=strict` and `ProtectHome=read-only` are implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations. In order to allow the service to write to certain directories, they have to be allow-listed using `ReadWritePaths=`, but care must be taken so that UID/GID recycling doesn't create security issues involving files created by the service. Use `RuntimeDirectory=` (see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service, owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated. Use `StateDirectory=`, `CacheDirectory=` and `LogsDirectory=` in order to assign a set of writable directories for specific purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID reuse (see below). If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit's processes do not get access to directories outside of these explicitly configured and managed ones. Specifically, do not use `BindPaths=` and be careful with `AF_UNIX` file descriptor passing for directory file descriptors, as this would permit processes to create files or directories owned by the dynamic user/group that are not subject to the lifecycle and access guarantees of the service.

[4,202,"Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See [setrlimit(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setrlimit.2.html) for details on the process resource limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair `soft:hard` to set both limits individually (e.g. \"`LimitAS=4G:16G`\"). Use the string `infinity` to configure no limit on a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. \"`LimitAS=16G`\"). For the limits referring to time values, the usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see [systemd.time(7)](systemd.time.html) for details). Note that if no time unit is specified for `LimitCPU=` the default unit of seconds is implied, while for `LimitRTTIME=` the default unit of microseconds is implied. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified for `LimitCPU=` will be rounded up implicitly to multiples of 1s. For `LimitNICE=` the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed with \"`+`\" or \"`-`\", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20…19. If not prefixed like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0…40 (with 0 being equivalent to 1).\n\nNote that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process, and may thus escape limits set. Also note that `LimitRSS=` is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in [systemd.resource-control(5)](systemd.resource-control.html) over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, `MemoryMax=` is a more powerful (and working) replacement for `LimitRSS=`.\n\nNote that `LimitNPROC=` will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of processes started (forked) by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running under the same UID. Please also note that the `LimitNPROC=` will not be enforced if the service is running as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations, `TasksMax=` (see [systemd.resource-control(5)](systemd.resource-control.html)) is typically a better choice than `LimitNPROC=`.\n\nResource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various `DefaultLimitCPU=`, `DefaultLimitFSIZE=`, … options available in [systemd-system.conf(5)](systemd-system.conf.html), and – if not configured there – the kernel or per-user defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user services, see below).\n\nFor system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user service (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise the limits above those set for the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service manager generally lacks the privileges to do so. In user context these configuration options are hence only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit to the maximum of the hard limit as configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration mechanisms differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to configure higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service encapsulating the user's service manager, i.e. the user's instance of `user@.service`. After making such changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.\n\n**Table 1. Resource limit directives, their equivalent ulimit shell commands and the unit used**\n\n| Directive | **ulimit** equivalent | Unit | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| LimitCPU= | ulimit -t | Seconds | \\- |\n| LimitFSIZE= | ulimit -f | Bytes | \\- |\n| LimitDATA= | ulimit -d | Bytes | Don't use.

No effect on Linux. |\n| LimitNOFILE= | ulimit -n | Number of File Descriptors | Don't use. Be careful when raising the soft limit above 1024, since [select(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html) cannot function with file descriptors above 1023 on Linux. Nowadays, the hard limit defaults to 524288, a very high value compared to historical defaults. Typically applications should increase their soft limit to the hard limit on their own, if they are OK with working with file descriptors above 1023, i.e. do not use [select(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html). Note that file descriptors are nowadays accounted like any other form of memory, thus there should not be any need to lower the hard limit. Use `MemoryMax=` to control overall service memory use, including file descriptor memory. |\n| LimitAS= | ulimit -v | Bytes | Don't use. This limits the allowed address range, not memory use!

Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour. Both from perspective of the host and from inside the unit, the relevant directories hence always appear directly below `/var/cache`, `/var/log` and `/var/lib`.\n\nUse `RuntimeDirectory=` to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind their lifetime to the daemon runtime. This is particularly useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create runtime directories in `/run/` due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime directory is cleaned up automatically after use.

If the service needs directories in a different location, a different mechanism has to be used to create them.\n\n[tmpfiles.d(5)](tmpfiles.d.html) provides functionality that overlaps with these options. Using these options is recommended, because the lifetime of the directories is tied directly to the lifetime of the unit, and it is not necessary to ensure that the `tmpfiles.d` configuration is executed before the unit is started.\n\nTo remove any of the directories created by these settings, use the **systemctl clean …** command on the relevant units, see [systemctl(1)](systemctl.html) for details.\n\nExample: if a system service unit has the following,\n\nRuntimeDirectory=foo/bar baz\n\nthe service manager creates `/run/foo` (if it does not exist), `/run/foo/bar`, and `/run/baz`.

In particular, note that mount propagation from host to unit will result in unmodified mounts to be created in the unit's namespace, i.e. writable mounts appearing on the host will be writable in the unit's namespace too, even when propagated below a path marked with `ReadOnlyPaths=`!

If true, access to any kind of namespacing is prohibited. Otherwise, a space-separated list of namespace type identifiers must be specified, consisting of any combination of: `cgroup`, `ipc`, `net`, `mnt`, `pid`, `user` and `uts`. Any namespace type listed is made accessible to the unit's processes, access to namespace types not listed is prohibited (allow-listing). By prepending the list with a single tilde character (\"`~`\") the effect may be inverted: only the listed namespace types will be made inaccessible, all unlisted ones are permitted (deny-listing). If the empty string is assigned, the default namespace restrictions are applied, which is equivalent to false. This option may appear more than once, in which case the namespace types are merged by `OR`, or by `AND` if the lines are prefixed with \"`~`\" (see examples below).

This option improves service security, as it makes harder for software exploits to change running code dynamically. However, the protection can be circumvented, if the service can write to a filesystem, which is not mounted with `noexec` (such as `/dev/shm`), or it can use `memfd_create()`. This can be prevented by making such file systems inaccessible to the service (e.g. `InaccessiblePaths=/dev/shm`) and installing further system call filters (`SystemCallFilter=~memfd_create`). Note that this feature is fully available on x86-64, and partially on x86. Specifically, the `shmat()` protection is not available on x86. Note that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this option.

Finally, the mounts are remounted again to the propagation mode configured with `MountFlags=`, see below.\n\nFile system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager. Mounts established in the namespace of the process created by `ExecStartPre=` will hence be cleaned up automatically as soon as that process exits and will not be available to subsequent processes forked off for `ExecStart=` (and similar applies to the various other commands configured for units).

Also, if execution of the service binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error handling logic might require access to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly. It might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging of such failures.\n\nIf you specify both types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered will take precedence and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a system call).

calls used by common system services, excluding any special purpose calls.

This list is defined statically in systemd based on a kernel version that was available when this systemd version was released. It will become progressively more out-of-date as the kernel is updated. |\n\n  \nNote, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be added to the groups above. Contents of the sets may also change between systemd versions. In addition, the list of system calls depends on the kernel version and architecture for which systemd was compiled. Use **systemd-analyze syscall-filter** to list the actual list of system calls in each filter.\n\nGenerally, allow-listing system calls (rather than deny-listing) is the safer mode of operation. It is recommended to enforce system call allow lists for all long-running system services. Specifically, the following lines are a relatively safe basic choice for the majority of system services:\n\n\\[Service\\]\nSystemCallFilter=@system-service\nSystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM\n\nNote that various kernel system calls are defined redundantly: there are multiple system calls for executing the same operation. For example, the `pidfd_send_signal()` system call may be used to execute operations similar to what can be done with the older `kill()` system call, hence blocking the latter without the former only provides weak protection. Since new system calls are added regularly to the kernel as development progresses, keeping system call deny lists comprehensive requires constant work. It is thus recommended to use allow-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system calls are by default implicitly blocked until the allow list is updated.\n\nAlso note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to work. The dynamic linker is required for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF binaries, which is how most distributions build packaged programs). This means that blocking these system calls (which include `open()`, `openat()` or `mmap()`) will make most programs typically shipped with generic distributions unusable.\n\nIt is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with `SystemCallFilter=~@mount`, in order to prohibit the unit's processes to undo the mappings. Specifically these are the options `PrivateTmp=`, `PrivateDevices=`, `ProtectSystem=`, `ProtectHome=`, `ProtectKernelTunables=`, `ProtectControlGroups=`, `ProtectKernelLogs=`, `ProtectClock=`, `ReadOnlyPaths=`, `InaccessiblePaths=` and `ReadWritePaths=`.","#SystemCallFilter=",187],

See [errno(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html) for a full list of error codes.

[4,253,"Takes a space-separated list of architecture identifiers to include in the system call filter. The known architecture identifiers are the same as for `ConditionArchitecture=` described in [systemd.unit(5)](systemd.unit.html), as well as `x32`, `mips64-n32`, `mips64-le-n32`, and the special identifier `native`. The special identifier `native` implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more precisely: to the architecture the system manager is compiled for). By default, this option is set to the empty list, i.e. no filtering is applied.\n\nIf this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system calls, and system calls of the specified architectures. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is treated as including x86-64 system calls. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as explained below, on x32.\n\nSystem call filtering is not equally effective on all architectures. For example, on x86 filtering of network socket-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations — a limitation that x86-64 does not have, however. On systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time — such as x86/x86-64 — it is hence recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary ABIs may not be used to circumvent the restrictions applied to the native ABI of the system. In particular, setting `SystemCallArchitectures=native` is a good choice for disabling non-native ABIs.\n\nSystem call architectures may also be restricted system-wide via the `SystemCallArchitectures=` option in the global configuration.

If the terminal is already being controlled by another process, the executed process waits until the current controlling process releases the terminal.\n\n`tty-force` is similar to `tty`, but the executed process is forcefully and immediately made the controlling process of the terminal, potentially removing previous controlling processes from the terminal.\n\n`tty-fail` is similar to `tty`, but if the terminal already has a controlling process start-up of the executed process fails.\n\nThe `data` option may be used to configure arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via standard input to the executed process. The data to pass is configured via `StandardInputText=`/`StandardInputData=` (see below). Note that the actual file descriptor type passed (memory file, regular file, UNIX pipe, …) might depend on the kernel and available privileges. In any case, the file descriptor is read-only, and when read returns the specified data followed by EOF.\n\nThe <code>file:<em><code>path</code></em></code> option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard input. An absolute path following the \"`:`\" character is expected, which may refer to a regular file, a FIFO or special file. If an `AF_UNIX` socket in the file system is specified, a stream socket is connected to it. The latter is useful for connecting standard input of processes to arbitrary system services.\n\nThe `socket` option is valid in socket-activated services only, and requires the relevant socket unit file (see [systemd.socket(5)](systemd.socket.html) for details) to have `Accept=yes` set, or to specify a single socket only. If this option is set, standard input will be connected to the socket the service was activated from, which is primarily useful for compatibility with daemons designed for use with the traditional [inetd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?inetd\\(8\\)) socket activation daemon (`$LISTEN_FDS` (and related) environment variables are not passed when `socket` value is configured).\n\nThe <code>fd:<em><code>name</code></em></code> option connects standard input to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. The name may be specified as part of this option, following a \"`:`\" character (e.g. \"`fd:foobar`\"). If no name is specified, the name \"`stdin`\" is implied (i.e. \"`fd`\" is equivalent to \"`fd:stdin`\"). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided via the `Sockets=` option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit.

If the TTY is used for output only, the executed process will not become the controlling process of the terminal, and will not fail or wait for other processes to release the terminal.\n\n`journal` connects standard output with the journal, which is accessible via [journalctl(1)](journalctl.html). Note that everything that is written to kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the specific option listed below is hence a superset of this one. (Also note that any external, additional syslog daemons receive their log data from the journal, too, hence this is the option to use when logging shall be processed with such a daemon.)\n\n`kmsg` connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via [dmesg(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html), in addition to the journal. The journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg anyway, in which case this option is no different from `journal`.\n\n`journal+console` and `kmsg+console` work in a similar way as the two options above but copy the output to the system console as well.\n\nThe <code>file:<em><code>path</code></em></code> option may be used to connect a specific file system object to standard output. The semantics are similar to the same option of `StandardInput=`, see above. If _`path`_ refers to a regular file on the filesystem, it is opened (created if it doesn't exist yet) for writing at the beginning of the file, but without truncating it. If standard input and output are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once — for reading as well as writing — and duplicated. This is particularly useful when the specified path refers to an `AF_UNIX` socket in the file system, as in that case only a single stream connection is created for both input and output.\n\n<code>append:<em><code>path</code></em></code> is similar to <code>file:<em><code>path</code></em></code> above, but it opens the file in append mode.\n\n<code>truncate:<em><code>path</code></em></code> is similar to <code>file:<em><code>path</code></em></code> above, but it truncates the file when opening it. For units with multiple command lines, e.g. `Type=oneshot` services with multiple `ExecStart=`, or services with `ExecCondition=`, `ExecStartPre=` or `ExecStartPost=`, the output file is reopened and therefore re-truncated for each command line. If the output file is truncated while another process still has the file open, e.g. by an `ExecReload=` running concurrently with an `ExecStart=`, and the other process continues writing to the file without adjusting its offset, then the space between the file pointers of the two processes may be filled with `NUL` bytes, producing a sparse file. Thus, <code>truncate:<em><code>path</code></em></code> is typically only useful for units where only one process runs at a time, such as services with a single `ExecStart=` and no `ExecStartPost=`, `ExecReload=`, `ExecStop=` or similar.\n\n`socket` connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation. The semantics are similar to the same option of `StandardInput=`, see above.\n\nThe <code>fd:<em><code>name</code></em></code> option connects standard output to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket unit. A name may be specified as part of this option, following a \"`:`\" character (e.g. \"<code>fd:<em><code>foobar</code></em></code>\"). If no name is specified, the name \"`stdout`\" is implied (i.e. \"`fd`\" is equivalent to \"`fd:stdout`\"). At least one socket unit defining the specified name must be provided via the `Sockets=` option, and the file descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple matches are found, the first one will be used. See `FileDescriptorName=` in [systemd.socket(5)](systemd.socket.html) for more details about named descriptors and their ordering.\n\nIf the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal or the kernel log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type `After=` on `systemd-journald.socket` (also see the \"Implicit Dependencies\" section above). Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below) will be an `AF_UNIX` stream socket, and not a pipe or FIFO that can be re-opened. This means when executing shell scripts the construct **echo \"hello\" > /dev/stderr** for writing text to stderr will not work. To mitigate this use the construct **echo \"hello\" >&2** instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall.\n\nIf `StandardInput=` is set to one of `tty`, `tty-force`, `tty-fail`, `socket`, or <code>fd:<em><code>name</code></em></code>, this setting defaults to `inherit`.\n\nIn other cases, this setting defaults to the value set with `DefaultStandardOutput=` in [systemd-system.conf(5)](systemd-system.conf.html), which defaults to `journal`.

Use this option to embed process input data directly in the unit file.\n\n`StandardInputText=` accepts arbitrary textual data. C-style escapes for special characters as well as the usual \"`%`\"-specifiers are resolved. Each time this setting is used the specified text is appended to the per-unit data buffer, followed by a newline character (thus every use appends a new line to the end of the buffer). Note that leading and trailing whitespace of lines configured with this option is removed. If an empty line is specified the buffer is cleared (hence, in order to insert an empty line, add an additional \"`\\n`\" to the end or beginning of a line).\n\n`StandardInputData=` accepts arbitrary binary data, encoded in [Base64](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.8). No escape sequences or specifiers are resolved. Any whitespace in the encoded version is ignored during decoding.\n\nNote that `StandardInputText=` and `StandardInputData=` operate on the same data buffer, and may be mixed in order to configure both binary and textual data for the same input stream.

The filtering is applied early in the logging pipeline, before any kind of further processing is done. Moreover, messages which pass through this filter successfully might still be dropped by filters applied at a later stage in the logging subsystem.

The data is only accessible to the user associated with the unit, via the `User=`/`DynamicUser=` settings (as well as the superuser). When available, the location of credentials is exported as the `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` environment variable to the unit's processes.\n\nThe `LoadCredential=` setting takes a textual ID to use as name for a credential plus a file system path, separated by a colon. The ID must be a short ASCII string suitable as filename in the filesystem, and may be chosen freely by the user. If the specified path is absolute it is opened as regular file and the credential data is read from it. If the absolute path refers to an `AF_UNIX` stream socket in the file system a connection is made to it (only once at unit start-up) and the credential data read from the connection, providing an easy IPC integration point for dynamically transferring credentials from other services.\n\nIf the specified path is not absolute and itself qualifies as valid credential identifier it is attempted to find a credential that the service manager itself received under the specified name — which may be used to propagate credentials from an invoking environment (e.g. a container manager that invoked the service manager) into a service. If no matching system credential is found, the directories `/etc/credstore/`, `/run/credstore/` and `/usr/lib/credstore/` are searched for files under the credential's name — which hence are recommended locations for credential data on disk. If `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` is used `/run/credstore.encrypted/`, `/etc/credstore.encrypted/`, and `/usr/lib/credstore.encrypted/` are searched as well.\n\nIf the file system path is omitted it is chosen identical to the credential name, i.e. this is a terse way to declare credentials to inherit from the service manager into a service. This option may be used multiple times, each time defining an additional credential to pass to the unit.\n\nIf an absolute path referring to a directory is specified, every file in that directory (recursively) will be loaded as a separate credential.

Specifically, the referenced path should refer to a file or socket with an encrypted credential, as implemented by [systemd-creds(1)](systemd-creds.html). This credential is loaded, decrypted, authenticated and then passed to the application in plaintext form, in the same way a regular credential specified via `LoadCredential=` would be. A credential configured this way may be symmetrically encrypted/authenticated with a secret key derived from the system's TPM2 security chip, or with a secret key stored in `/var/lib/systemd/credentials.secret`, or with both. Using encrypted and authenticated credentials improves security as credentials are not stored in plaintext and only authenticated and decrypted into plaintext the moment a service requiring them is started. Moreover, credentials may be bound to the local hardware and installations, so that they cannot easily be analyzed offline, or be generated externally. When `DevicePolicy=` is set to \"`closed`\" or \"`strict`\", or set to \"`auto`\" and `DeviceAllow=` is set, or `PrivateDevices=` is set, then this setting adds `/dev/tpmrm0` with `rw` mode to `DeviceAllow=`.

This is particularly useful in combination with `DynamicUser=` as this way privileged data can be made available to processes running under a dynamic UID (i.e. not a previously known one) without having to open up access to all users.\n\nIn order to reference the path a credential may be read from within a `ExecStart=` command line use \"`${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred`\", e.g. \"`ExecStart=cat ${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred`\". In order to reference the path a credential may be read from within a `Environment=` line use \"`%d/mycred`\", e.g. \"`Environment=MYCREDPATH=%d/mycred`\". For system services the path may also be referenced as \"<code>/run/credentials/<em><code>UNITNAME</code></em></code>\" in cases where no interpolation is possible, e.g. configuration files of software that does not yet support credentials natively. `$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY` is considered the primary interface to look for credentials, though, since it also works for user services.\n\nCurrently, an accumulated credential size limit of 1 MB per unit is enforced.\n\nThe service manager itself may receive system credentials that can be propagated to services from a hosting container manager or VM hypervisor. See the [Container Interface](https://systemd.io/CONTAINER_INTERFACE) documentation for details about the former. For the latter, pass [DMI/SMBIOS](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios) OEM string table entries (field type 11) with a prefix of \"`io.systemd.credential:`\" or \"`io.systemd.credential.binary:`\". In both cases a key/value pair separated by \"`=`\" is expected, in the latter case the right-hand side is Base64 decoded when parsed (thus permitting binary data to be passed in). Example [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/index.html) switch: \"`-smbios type=11,value=io.systemd.credential:xx=yy`\", or \"`-smbios type=11,value=io.systemd.credential.binary:rick=TmV2ZXIgR29ubmEgR2l2ZSBZb3UgVXA=`\". Alternatively, use the **qemu** \"`fw_cfg`\" node \"`opt/io.systemd.credentials/`\". Example **qemu** switch: \"`-fw_cfg name=opt/io.systemd.credentials/mycred,string=supersecret`\". They may also be passed from the UEFI firmware environment via [systemd-stub(7)](systemd-stub.html), from the initrd (see [systemd(1)](systemd.html)), or be specified on the kernel command line using the \"`systemd.set_credential=`\" and \"`systemd.set_credential_binary=`\" switches (see [systemd(1)](systemd.html) – this is not recommended since unprivileged userspace can read the kernel command line).\n\nIf referencing an `AF_UNIX` stream socket to connect to, the connection will originate from an abstract namespace socket, that includes information about the unit and the credential ID in its socket name. Use [getpeername(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpeername.2.html) to query this information. The returned socket name is formatted as `NUL` _`RANDOM`_ \"`/unit/`\" _`UNIT`_ \"`/`\" _`ID`_, i.e. a `NUL` byte (as required for abstract namespace socket names), followed by a random string (consisting of alphadecimal characters), followed by the literal string \"`/unit/`\", followed by the requesting unit name, followed by the literal character \"`/`\", followed by the textual credential ID requested. Example: \"`\\0adf9d86b6eda275e/unit/foobar.service/credx`\" in case the credential \"`credx`\" is requested for a unit \"`foobar.service`\". This functionality is useful for using a single listening socket to serve credentials to multiple consumers.\n\nFor further information see [System and Service Credentials](https://systemd.io/CREDENTIALS) documentation.","#LoadCredential=ID:PATH",247],
[4,278,"Pass one or more credentials to the unit. Takes a credential name for which we'll attempt to find a credential that the service manager itself received under the specified name — which may be used to propagate credentials from an invoking environment (e.g. a container manager that invoked the service manager) into a service. If the credential name is a glob, all credentials matching the glob are passed to the unit. Matching credentials are searched for in the system credentials, the encrypted system credentials, and under `/etc/credstore/`, `/run/credstore/`, `/usr/lib/credstore/`, `/run/credstore.encrypted/`, `/etc/credstore.encrypted/`, and `/usr/lib/credstore.encrypted/` in that order. When multiple credentials of the same name are found, the first one found is used.\n\nThe globbing expression implements a restrictive subset of [glob(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html): only a single trailing \"`*`\" wildcard may be specified. Both \"`?`\" and \"`[]`\" wildcards are not permitted, nor are \"`*`\" wildcards anywhere except at the end of the glob expression.\n\nWhen multiple credentials of the same name are found, credentials found by `LoadCredential=` and `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` take priority over credentials found by `ImportCredential=`.","#ImportCredential=GLOB",254],
[4,279,"The `SetCredential=` setting is similar to `LoadCredential=` but accepts a literal value to use as data for the credential, instead of a file system path to read the data from. Do not use this option for data that is supposed to be secret, as it is accessible to unprivileged processes via IPC. It's only safe to use this for user IDs, public key material and similar non-sensitive data. For everything else use `LoadCredential=`. In order to embed binary data into the credential data use C-style escaping (i.e. \"`\\n`\" to embed a newline, or \"`\\x00`\" to embed a `NUL` byte).\n\nThe `SetCredentialEncrypted=` setting is identical to `SetCredential=` but expects an encrypted credential in literal form as value. This allows embedding confidential credentials securely directly in unit files. Use [systemd-creds(1)](systemd-creds.html)' `-p` switch to generate suitable `SetCredentialEncrypted=` lines directly from plaintext credentials. For further details see `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` above.\n\nWhen multiple credentials of the same name are found, credentials found by `LoadCredential=`, `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` and `ImportCredential=` take priority over credentials found by `SetCredential=`. As such, `SetCredential=` will act as default if no credentials are found by any of the former. In this case not being able to retrieve the credential from the path specified in `LoadCredential=` or `LoadCredentialEncrypted=` is not considered fatal.","#SetCredential=ID:VALUE",247],

The supported timespans match what the kernel provides, and are limited to \"`10sec`\", \"`1min`\" and \"`5min`\". The \"`full`\" PSI will be checked first, and if not found \"`some`\" will be checked. For more details, see the documentation on [PSI (Pressure Stall Information)](https://docs.kernel.org/accounting/psi.html) .\n\nOptionally, the threshold value can be prefixed with the slice unit under which the pressure will be checked, followed by a \"`:`\".

[4,435,"Similar to the `ConditionArchitecture=`, `ConditionVirtualization=`, …, condition settings described above, these settings add assertion checks to the start-up of the unit. However, unlike the conditions settings, any assertion setting that is not met results in failure of the start job (which means this is logged loudly). Note that hitting a configured assertion does not cause the unit to enter the \"`failed`\" state (or in fact result in any state change of the unit), it affects only the job queued for it. Use assertion expressions for units that cannot operate when specific requirements are not met, and when this is something the administrator or user should look into.","#AssertArchitecture=",218],

This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed names are used. At installation time, **systemctl enable** will create symlinks from these names to the unit filename. Note that not all unit types support such alias names, and this setting is not supported for them. Specifically, mount, slice, swap, and automount units do not support aliasing.","#Alias=",201],
[4,437,"This option may be used more than once, or a space-separated list of unit names may be given. A symbolic link is created in the `.wants/`, `.requires/`, or `.upholds/` directory of each of the listed units when this unit is installed by **systemctl enable**. This has the effect of a dependency of type `Wants=`, `Requires=`, or `Upholds=` being added from the listed unit to the current unit. See the description of the mentioned dependency types in the \\[Unit\\] section for details.\n\nIn case of template units listing non template units, the listing unit must have `DefaultInstance=` set, or **systemctl enable** must be called with an instance name. The instance (default or specified) will be added to the `.wants/`, `.requires/`, or `.upholds/` list of the listed unit. For example, **WantedBy=getty.target** in a service `getty@.service` will result in **systemctl enable getty\\@tty2.service** creating a `getty.target.wants/getty\\@tty2.service` link to `getty@.service`. This also applies to listing specific instances of templated units: this specific instance will gain the dependency. A template unit may also list a template unit, in which case a generic dependency will be added where each instance of the listing unit will have a dependency on an instance of the listed template with the same instance value. For example, **WantedBy=container@.target** in a service `monitor@.service` will result in **systemctl enable monitor@.service** creating a `container@.target.wants/monitor@.service` link to `monitor@.service`, which applies to all instances of `container@.target`.","#WantedBy=",201],
