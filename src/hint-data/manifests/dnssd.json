The following expansions are understood:\n\n**Table 1. Specifiers available**\n\n| Specifier | Meaning | Details |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| \"`%a`\" | Architecture | A short string identifying the architecture of the local system.

See the architectures defined for `ConditionArchitecture=` in [systemd.unit(5)](systemd.unit.html) for a full list. |\n| \"`%A`\" | Operating system image version | The operating system image version identifier of the running system, as read from the `IMAGE_VERSION=` field of `/etc/os-release`. If not set, resolves to an empty string. See [os-release(5)](os-release.html) for more information. |\n| \"`%b`\" | Boot ID | The boot ID of the running system, formatted as string. See [random(4)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/random.4.html) for more information. |\n| \"`%B`\" | Operating system build ID | The operating system build identifier of the running system, as read from the `BUILD_ID=` field of `/etc/os-release`. If not set, resolves to an empty string. See [os-release(5)](os-release.html) for more information. |\n| \"`%H`\" | Host name | The hostname of the running system. |\n| \"`%m`\" | Machine ID | The machine ID of the running system, formatted as string. See [machine-id(5)](machine-id.html) for more information. |\n| \"`%M`\" | Operating system image identifier | The operating system image identifier of the running system, as read from the `IMAGE_ID=` field of `/etc/os-release`.

If not set, resolves to an empty string. See [os-release(5)](os-release.html) for more information. |\n| \"`%W`\" | Operating system variant ID | The operating system variant identifier of the running system, as read from the `VARIANT_ID=` field of `/etc/os-release`. If not set, resolves to an empty string. See [os-release(5)](os-release.html) for more information. |\n| \"`%%`\" | Single percent sign | Use \"`%%`\" in place of \"`%`\" to specify a single percent sign. |","#Name=",236],
