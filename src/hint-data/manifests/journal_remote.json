[4,6,"These are analogous to `SystemMaxUse=`, `SystemKeepFree=`, `SystemMaxFileSize=` and `SystemMaxFiles=` in [journald.conf(5)](journald.conf.html).\n\n`MaxUse=` controls how much disk space the **systemd-journal-remote** may use up at most. `KeepFree=` controls how much disk space **systemd-journal-remote** shall leave free for other uses. **systemd-journal-remote** will respect both limits and use the smaller of the two values.\n\n`MaxFiles=` controls how many individual journal files to keep at most. Note that only archived files are deleted to reduce the number of files until this limit is reached; active files will stay around. This means that, in effect, there might still be more journal files around in total than this limit after a vacuuming operation is complete.\n\nAdded in version 253.","#MaxUse="],
