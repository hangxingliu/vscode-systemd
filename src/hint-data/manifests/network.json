Note that the prefix length must be equal or larger than 8 for IPv4, and 64 for IPv6. The allocated range is checked against all current network interfaces and all known network configuration files to avoid address range conflicts. The default system-wide pool consists of 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, and fd00::/8 for IPv6.

If a single-label hostname is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved.\n\nBoth \"search\" and \"routing-only\" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for hostnames ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any \"search domains\" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface.\n\nThe \"routing-only\" domain \"`~.`\" (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect.

The benefit of using this setting is that it may be possible to apply interface independent part of NetLabel configuration at very early stage of system boot sequence, at the time when the network interfaces are not available yet, with [netlabelctl(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/netlabelctl.8.html), and the per-interface configuration with **systemd-networkd** once the interfaces appear later. Currently this feature is only implemented for SELinux.\n\nThe option expects a single NetLabel label. The label must conform to lexical restrictions of LSM labels.
