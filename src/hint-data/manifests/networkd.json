[4,3,"A boolean. When true, **systemd-networkd** will remove rules that are not configured in .network files (except for rules with protocol \"`kernel`\").

[4,4,"A boolean. When true, **systemd-networkd** will remove routes that are not configured in .network files (except for routes with protocol \"`kernel`\", \"`dhcp`\" when `KeepConfiguration=` is true or \"`dhcp`\", and \"`static`\" when `KeepConfiguration=` is true or \"`static`\").

[4,5,"Defines the route table name. Takes a whitespace-separated list of the pairs of route table name and number. The route table name and number in each pair are separated with a colon, i.e., \"``_`name`_:_`number`_``\". The route table name must not be \"`default`\", \"`main`\", or \"`local`\", as these route table names are predefined with route table number 253, 254, and 255, respectively. The route table number must be an integer in the range 1…4294967295, except for predefined numbers 253, 254, and 255. This setting can be specified multiple times.

If a system does not have valid product UUID, then an application-specific [machine-id(5)](machine-id.html) is used as a DUID value. About the application-specific machine ID, see [sd\\_id128\\_get\\_machine\\_app\\_specific(3)](sd_id128_get_machine_app_specific.html).\n\nAdded in version 230.\n\n``link-layer-time[:_`TIME`_]``, `link-layer`[¶](#link-layer-time%5B:TIME%5D \"Permalink to this term\")\n\nIf \"`link-layer-time`\" or \"`link-layer`\" is specified, then the MAC address of the interface is used as a DUID value. The value \"`link-layer-time`\" can take additional time value after a colon, e.g. \"`link-layer-time:2018-01-23 12:34:56 UTC`\". The default time value is \"`2000-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`\".\n\nAdded in version 240.\n\nIn all cases, `DUIDRawData=` can be used to override the actual DUID value that is used.\n\nAdded in version 230.","#DUIDType="],
[4,8,"Specifies the DHCP DUID value as a single newline-terminated, hexadecimal string, with each byte separated by \"`:`\". The DUID that is sent is composed of the DUID type specified by `DUIDType=` and the value configured here.\n\nThe DUID value specified here overrides the DUID that [systemd-networkd.service(8)](systemd-networkd.service.html) generates from the machine ID. To configure DUID per-network, see [systemd.network(5)](systemd.network.html). The configured DHCP DUID should conform to the specification in [RFC 3315](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315#section-9), [RFC 6355](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6355).
