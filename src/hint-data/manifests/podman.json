The format of this is `HOST-DEVICE[:CONTAINER-DEVICE][:PERMISSIONS]`, where `HOST-DEVICE` is the path of the device node on the host, `CONTAINER-DEVICE` is the path of the device node in the container, and `PERMISSIONS` is a list of permissions combining ‘r’ for read, ‘w’ for write, and ‘m’ for mknod(2).

The following values are supported:\n\n*   `registry`: Requires a fully-qualified image reference (e.g., quay.io/podman/stable:latest) to be used to create the container. This enforcement is necessary to know which image to actually check and pull. If an image ID was used, Podman does not know which image to check/pull anymore.\n    \n*   `local`: Tells Podman to compare the image a container is using to the image with its raw name in local storage. If an image is updated locally, Podman simply restarts the systemd unit executing the container.","#autoupdate"],

Equivalent to the Podman `--cgroups` option.\n\nBy default, the cgroups mode of the container created by Quadlet is `split`, which differs from the default (`enabled`) used by the Podman CLI.\n\nIf the container joins a pod (i.e. `Pod=` is specified), you may want to change this to `no-conmon` or `enabled` so that pod level cgroup resource limits can take effect.","#cgroupsmode"],

It is recommended to use a fully qualified image name rather than a short name, both for performance and robustness reasons.\n\nThe format of the name is the same as when passed to `podman pull`. So, it supports using `:tag` or digests to guarantee the specific image version.\n\nAs a special case, if the `name` of the image ends with `.image`, Quadlet will use the image pulled by the corresponding `.image` file, and the generated systemd service contains a dependency on the `$name-image.service`.

[4,46,"Specify a custom network for the container. This has the same format as the `--network` option to `podman run`. For example, use `host` to use the host network in the container, or `none` to not set up networking in the container.\n\nAs a special case, if the `name` of the network ends with `.network`, a Podman network called `systemd-$name` is used, and the generated systemd service contains a dependency on the `$name-network.service`. Such a network can be automatically created by using a `$name.network` Quadlet file.\n\nAnother special case is that if the `name` ends with `.container`, the container will reuse the network stack of another container created by `$name.container`.

[4,49,"By default, Podman is run in such a way that the systemd startup notify command is handled by the container runtime. In other words, the service is deemed started when the container runtime starts the child in the container. However, if the container application supports [sd\\_notify](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_notify.html), then setting `Notify` to true passes the notification details to the container allowing it to notify of startup on its own.\n\nIn addition, setting `Notify` to `healthy` will postpone startup notifications until such time as the container is marked healthy, as determined by Podman healthchecks.

[4,53,"Exposes a port, or a range of ports (e.g. `50-59`), from the container to the host. Equivalent to the Podman `--publish` option. The format is similar to the Podman options, which is of the form `ip:hostPort:containerPort`, `ip::containerPort`, `hostPort:containerPort` or `containerPort`, where the number of host and container ports must be the same (in the case of a range).\n\nIf the IP is set to 0.0.0.0 or not set at all, the port is bound on all IPv4 addresses on the host; use \\[::\\] for IPv6.\n\nNote that not listing a host port means that Podman automatically selects one, and it may be different for each invocation of service. This makes that a less useful option. The allocated port can be found with the `podman port` command.\n\nThis key can be listed multiple times.","#publishport"],
