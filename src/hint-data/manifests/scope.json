[4,1,"Configure the out-of-memory (OOM) killing policy for the kernel and the userspace OOM killer [systemd-oomd.service(8)](systemd-oomd.service.html). On Linux, when memory becomes scarce to the point that the kernel has trouble allocating memory for itself, it might decide to kill a running process in order to free up memory and reduce memory pressure. Note that `systemd-oomd.service` is a more flexible solution that aims to prevent out-of-memory situations for the userspace too, not just the kernel, by attempting to terminate services earlier, before the kernel would have to act.\n\nThis setting takes one of `continue`, `stop` or `kill`. If set to `continue` and a process in the unit is killed by the OOM killer, this is logged but the unit continues running. If set to `stop` the event is logged but the unit is terminated cleanly by the service manager. If set to `kill` and one of the unit's processes is killed by the OOM killer the kernel is instructed to kill all remaining processes of the unit too, by setting the `memory.oom.group` attribute to `1`; also see kernel page [Control Group v2](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html).\n\nDefaults to the setting `DefaultOOMPolicy=` in [systemd-system.conf(5)](systemd-system.conf.html) is set to, except for units where `Delegate=` is turned on, where it defaults to `continue`.\n\nUse the `OOMScoreAdjust=` setting to configure whether processes of the unit shall be considered preferred or less preferred candidates for process termination by the Linux OOM killer logic. See [systemd.exec(5)](systemd.exec.html) for details.\n\nThis setting also applies to [systemd-oomd.service(8)](systemd-oomd.service.html). Similarly to the kernel OOM kills performed by the kernel, this setting determines the state of the unit after **systemd-oomd** kills a cgroup associated with it.\n\nAdded in version 243.","#OOMPolicy="],
