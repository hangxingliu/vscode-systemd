[6,1,"Socket"],
[4,1,"Specifies an address to listen on for a stream (`SOCK_STREAM`), datagram (`SOCK_DGRAM`), or sequential packet (`SOCK_SEQPACKET`) socket, respectively. The address can be written in various formats:\n\nIf the address starts with a slash (\"`/`\"), it is read as file system socket in the `AF_UNIX` socket family.\n\nIf the address starts with an at symbol (\"`@`\"), it is read as abstract namespace socket in the `AF_UNIX` family. The \"`@`\" is replaced with a `NUL` character before binding. For details, see [unix(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html).\n\nIf the address string is a single number, it is read as port number to listen on via IPv6. Depending on the value of `BindIPv6Only=` (see below) this might result in the service being available via both IPv6 and IPv4 (default) or just via IPv6.\n\nIf the address string is a string in the format \"<code><em><code>v.w.x.y</code></em>:<em><code>z</code></em></code>\", it is interpreted as IPv4 address _`v.w.x.y`_ and port _`z`_.\n\nIf the address string is a string in the format \"<code>[<em><code>x</code></em>]:<em><code>y</code></em></code>\", it is interpreted as IPv6 address _`x`_ and port _`y`_. An optional interface scope (interface name or number) may be specified after a \"`%`\" symbol: \"<code>[<em><code>x</code></em>]:<em><code>y</code></em>%<em><code>dev</code></em></code>\". Interface scopes are only useful with link-local addresses, because the kernel ignores them in other cases. Note that if an address is specified as IPv6, it might still make the service available via IPv4 too, depending on the `BindIPv6Only=` setting (see below).\n\nIf the address string is a string in the format \"<code>vsock:<em><code>x</code></em>:<em><code>y</code></em></code>\", it is read as CID _`x`_ on a port _`y`_ address in the `AF_VSOCK` family. The CID is a unique 32-bit integer identifier in `AF_VSOCK` analogous to an IP address. Specifying the CID is optional, and may be set to the empty string. \"`vsock`\" may be replaced with \"`vsock-stream`\", \"`vsock-dgram`\" or \"`vsock-seqpacket`\" to force usage of the corresponding socket type.\n\nNote that `SOCK_SEQPACKET` (i.e. `ListenSequentialPacket=`) is only available for `AF_UNIX` sockets. `SOCK_STREAM` (i.e. `ListenStream=`) when used for IP sockets refers to TCP sockets, `SOCK_DGRAM` (i.e. `ListenDatagram=`) to UDP.\n\nThese options may be specified more than once, in which case incoming traffic on any of the sockets will trigger service activation, and all listed sockets will be passed to the service, regardless of whether there is incoming traffic on them or not. If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of addresses to listen on is reset, all prior uses of any of these options will have no effect.\n\nIt is also possible to have more than one socket unit for the same service when using `Service=`, and the service will receive all the sockets configured in all the socket units. Sockets configured in one unit are passed in the order of configuration, but no ordering between socket units is specified.\n\nIf an IP address is used here, it is often desirable to listen on it before the interface it is configured on is up and running, and even regardless of whether it will be up and running at any point. To deal with this, it is recommended to set the `FreeBind=` option described below.","#ListenStream=",null],
[4,2,"Specifies a file system FIFO (see [fifo(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fifo.7.html) for details) to listen on. This expects an absolute file system path as argument. Behavior otherwise is very similar to the `ListenDatagram=` directive above.","#ListenFIFO=",null],
[4,3,"Specifies a special file in the file system to listen on. This expects an absolute file system path as argument. Behavior otherwise is very similar to the `ListenFIFO=` directive above. Use this to open character device nodes as well as special files in `/proc/` and `/sys/`.","#ListenSpecial=",null],
[4,4,"Specifies a Netlink family to create a socket for to listen on. This expects a short string referring to the `AF_NETLINK` family name (such as `audit` or `kobject-uevent`) as argument, optionally suffixed by a whitespace followed by a multicast group integer. Behavior otherwise is very similar to the `ListenDatagram=` directive above.","#ListenNetlink=",null],
[4,5,"Specifies a POSIX message queue name to listen on (see [mq\\_overview(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mq_overview.7.html) for details). This expects a valid message queue name (i.e. beginning with \"`/`\"). Behavior otherwise is very similar to the `ListenFIFO=` directive above. On Linux message queue descriptors are actually file descriptors and can be inherited between processes.","#ListenMessageQueue=",null],
[4,6,"Specifies a [USB FunctionFS](https://docs.kernel.org/usb/functionfs.html) endpoints location to listen on, for implementation of USB gadget functions. This expects an absolute file system path of a FunctionFS mount point as the argument. Behavior otherwise is very similar to the `ListenFIFO=` directive above. Use this to open the FunctionFS endpoint `ep0`. When using this option, the activated service has to have the `USBFunctionDescriptors=` and `USBFunctionStrings=` options set.","#ListenUSBFunction=",227],
[4,7,"Takes one of `udplite` or `sctp`. The socket will use the UDP-Lite (`IPPROTO_UDPLITE`) or SCTP (`IPPROTO_SCTP`) protocol, respectively.","#SocketProtocol=",229],
[4,8,"Takes one of `default`, `both` or `ipv6-only`. Controls the IPV6\\_V6ONLY socket option (see [ipv6(7)](http://linux.die.net/man/7/ipv6) for details). If `both`, IPv6 sockets bound will be accessible via both IPv4 and IPv6. If `ipv6-only`, they will be accessible via IPv6 only. If `default` (which is the default, surprise!), the system wide default setting is used, as controlled by `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only`, which in turn defaults to the equivalent of `both`.","#BindIPv6Only=",null],
[4,9,"Takes an unsigned 32-bit integer argument. Specifies the number of connections to queue that have not been accepted yet. This setting matters only for stream and sequential packet sockets. See [listen(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html) for details. Defaults to 4294967295. Note that this value is silently capped by the \"`net.core.somaxconn`\" sysctl, which typically defaults to 4096, so typically the sysctl is the setting that actually matters.","#Backlog=",null],
[4,10,"Specifies a network interface name to bind this socket to. If set, traffic will only be accepted from the specified network interfaces. This controls the `SO_BINDTODEVICE` socket option (see [socket(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html) for details). If this option is used, an implicit dependency from this socket unit on the network interface device unit is created (see [systemd.device(5)](systemd.device.html)). Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be added to the unit (see above).","#BindToDevice=",null],
[4,11,"Takes a UNIX user/group name. When specified, all `AF_UNIX` sockets and FIFO nodes in the file system are owned by the specified user and group. If unset (the default), the nodes are owned by the root user/group (if run in system context) or the invoking user/group (if run in user context). If only a user is specified but no group, then the group is derived from the user's default group.","#SocketUser=",214],
[4,12,"If listening on a file system socket or FIFO, this option specifies the file system access mode used when creating the file node. Takes an access mode in octal notation. Defaults to 0666.","#SocketMode=",null],
[4,13,"If listening on a file system socket or FIFO, the parent directories are automatically created if needed. This option specifies the file system access mode used when creating these directories. Takes an access mode in octal notation. Defaults to 0755.","#DirectoryMode=",null],
[4,14,"Takes a boolean argument. If yes, a service instance is spawned for each incoming connection and only the connection socket is passed to it. If no, all listening sockets themselves are passed to the started service unit, and only one service unit is spawned for all connections (also see above). This value is ignored for datagram sockets and FIFOs where a single service unit unconditionally handles all incoming traffic. Defaults to `no`. For performance reasons, it is recommended to write new daemons only in a way that is suitable for `Accept=no`. A daemon listening on an `AF_UNIX` socket may, but does not need to, call [close(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html) on the received socket before exiting. However, it must not unlink the socket from a file system. It should not invoke [shutdown(2)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shutdown.2.html) on sockets it got with `Accept=no`, but it may do so for sockets it got with `Accept=yes` set. Setting `Accept=yes` is mostly useful to allow daemons designed for usage with [inetd(8)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?inetd\\(8\\)) to work unmodified with systemd socket activation.\n\nNote that depending on this setting the services activated by units of this type are either regular services (in case of `Accept=``no`) or instances of templated services (in case of `Accept=``yes`). See the Description section above for a more detailed discussion of the naming rules of triggered services.\n\nFor IPv4 and IPv6 connections, the `REMOTE_ADDR` environment variable will contain the remote IP address, and `REMOTE_PORT` will contain the remote port. This is the same as the format used by CGI. For `SOCK_RAW`, the port is the IP protocol.\n\nIt is recommended to set `CollectMode=inactive-or-failed` for service instances activated via `Accept=yes`, to ensure that failed connection services are cleaned up and released from memory, and do not accumulate.","#Accept=",null],
[4,15,"Takes a boolean argument. May only be used in conjunction with `ListenSpecial=`. If true, the specified special file is opened in read-write mode, if false, in read-only mode. Defaults to false.","#Writable=",227],
[4,16,"Takes a boolean argument. May only be used when `Accept=no`. If yes, the socket's buffers are cleared after the triggered service exited. This causes any pending data to be flushed and any pending incoming connections to be rejected. If no, the socket's buffers won't be cleared, permitting the service to handle any pending connections after restart, which is the usually expected behaviour. Defaults to `no`.","#FlushPending=",247],
[4,17,"The maximum number of connections to simultaneously run services instances for, when `Accept=yes` is set. If more concurrent connections are coming in, they will be refused until at least one existing connection is terminated. This setting has no effect on sockets configured with `Accept=no` or datagram sockets. Defaults to 64.","#MaxConnections=",null],
[4,18,"The maximum number of connections for a service per source IP address (in case of IPv4/IPv6), per source CID (in case of `AF_VSOCK`), or source UID (in case of `AF_UNIX`). This is very similar to the `MaxConnections=` directive above. Defaults to 0, i.e. disabled.","#MaxConnectionsPerSource=",232],

[4,24,"Takes an integer argument controlling the priority for all traffic sent from this socket. This controls the `SO_PRIORITY` socket option (see [socket(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html) for details.).","#Priority=",null],
[4,25,"Takes time (in seconds) as argument. If set, the listening process will be awakened only when data arrives on the socket, and not immediately when connection is established. When this option is set, the `TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` socket option will be used (see [tcp(7)](http://linux.die.net/man/7/tcp)), and the kernel will ignore initial ACK packets without any data. The argument specifies the approximate amount of time the kernel should wait for incoming data before falling back to the normal behavior of honoring empty ACK packets. This option is beneficial for protocols where the client sends the data first (e.g. HTTP, in contrast to SMTP), because the server process will not be woken up unnecessarily before it can take any action.\n\nIf the client also uses the `TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` option, the latency of the initial connection may be reduced, because the kernel will send data in the final packet establishing the connection (the third packet in the \"three-way handshake\").\n\nDisabled by default.","#DeferAcceptSec=",216],
