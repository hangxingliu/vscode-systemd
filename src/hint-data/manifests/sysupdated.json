[4,1,"Specifies the minimum version to require for this transfer to take place. If the source or target patterns in this transfer definition match files older than this version they will be considered obsolete, and never be considered for the update operation.","#MinVersion=",251],
[4,2,"Takes one or more version strings to mark as \"protected\". Protected versions are never removed while making room for new, updated versions. This is useful to ensure that the currently booted OS version (or auxiliary resources associated with it) is not replaced/overwritten during updates, in order to avoid runtime file system corruptions.\n\nLike many of the settings in these configuration files this setting supports specifier expansion. It's particularly useful to set this setting to one of the \"`%A`\", \"`%B`\" or \"`%w`\" specifiers to automatically refer to the current OS version of the running system. See below for details on supported specifiers.","#ProtectVersion=",251],
[4,3,"Takes a boolean, defaults to yes. Controls whether to cryptographically verify downloaded resources (specifically: validate the GPG signatures for downloaded `SHA256SUMS` manifest files, via their detached signature files `SHA256SUMS.gpg` in combination with the system keyring `/usr/lib/systemd/import-pubring.gpg` or `/etc/systemd/import-pubring.gpg`).\n\nThis option is essential to provide integrity guarantees for downloaded resources and thus should be left enabled, outside of test environments.\n\nNote that the downloaded payload files are unconditionally checked against the SHA256 hashes listed in the manifest. This option only controls whether the signatures of these manifests are verified.\n\nThis option only has an effect if the source resource type is selected as `url-file` or `url-tar`, as integrity and authentication checking is only available for transfers from remote sources.","#Verify=",251],
[4,4,"Specifies the resource type of the source for the transfer. Takes one of `url-file`, `url-tar`, `tar`, `regular-file`, `directory` or `subvolume`. For details about the resource types, see above. This option is mandatory.\n\nNote that only certain combinations of source and target resource types are supported, see above.","#Type=",251],
[4,5,"Specifies where to find source versions of this resource.\n\nIf the source type is selected as `url-file` or `url-tar` this must be a HTTP/HTTPS URL. The URL is suffixed with `/SHA256SUMS` to acquire the manifest file, with `/SHA256SUMS.gpg` to acquire the detached signature file for it, and with the file names listed in the manifest file in case an update is executed and a resource shall be downloaded.\n\nFor all other source resource types this must be a local path in the file system, referring to a local directory to find the versions of this resource in.","#Path=",251],
[4,6,"Specifies one or more file name match patterns that select the subset of files that are update candidates as source for this transfer. See above for details on match patterns.\n\nThis option is mandatory. Any pattern listed must contain at least the \"`@v`\" wildcard, so that a version identifier may be extracted from the filename. All other wildcards are optional.\n\nIf the source type is `regular-file` or `directory`, the pattern may contain slash characters. In this case it will match the file or directory in corresponding subdirectory. For example \"`MatchPattern=foo_@v/bar.efi`\" will match \"`bar.efi`\" in directory \"`foo_1`\".","#MatchPattern=",251],
[4,7,"Specifies the resource type of the target for the transfer. Takes one of `partition`, `regular-file`, `directory` or `subvolume`. For details about the resource types, see above. This option is mandatory.\n\nNote that only certain combinations of source and target resource types are supported, see above.","#Type=1",251],
[4,8,"Specifies a file system path where to look for already installed versions or place newly downloaded versions of this configured resource. If `Type=` is set to `partition`, expects a path to a (whole) block device node, or the special string \"`auto`\" in which case the block device which contains the root file system of the currently booted system is automatically determined and used. If `Type=` is set to `regular-file`, `directory` or `subvolume`, must refer to a path in the local file system referencing the directory to find or place the version files or directories under.\n\nNote that this mechanism cannot be used to create or remove partitions, in case `Type=` is set to `partition`. Partitions must exist already, and a special partition label \"`_empty`\" is used to indicate empty partitions. To automatically generate suitable partitions on first boot, use a tool such as [systemd-repart(8)](systemd-repart.html).","#Path=1",251],
[4,9,"Specifies what partition `Path=` should be relative to. Takes one of `root`, `esp`, `xbootldr`, or `boot`. If unspecified, defaults to `root`.\n\nIf set to `boot`, the specified `Path=` will be resolved relative to the mount point of the $BOOT partition (i.e. the ESP or XBOOTLDR), as defined by the [Boot Loader Specification](https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/boot_loader_specification).\n\nThe values `esp`, `xbootldr`, and `boot` are only supported when `Type=` is set to `regular-file` or `directory`.","#PathRelativeTo=",254],
[4,10,"Specifies one or more file name or partition label match patterns that select the subset of files or partitions that are update candidates as targets for this transfer. See above for details on match patterns.\n\nThis option is mandatory. Any pattern listed must contain at least the \"`@v`\" wildcard, so that a version identifier may be extracted from the filename. All other wildcards are optional.\n\nThis pattern is both used for matching existing installed versions and for determining the name of new versions to install. If multiple patterns are specified, the first specified is used for naming newly installed versions.\n\nIf the target type is `regular-file` or `directory`, the pattern may contain slash characters. In this case it will match the file or directory in corresponding subdirectory. For example \"`MatchPattern=foo_@v/bar.efi`\" will match \"`bar.efi`\" in directory \"`foo_1`\". Directories in the path will be created when file is installed. Empty directories will be removed when file is removed.","#MatchPattern=1",251],
[4,11,"When the target `Type=` is chosen as `partition`, specifies the GPT partition type to look for. Only partitions of this type are considered, all other partitions are ignored. If not specified, the GPT partition type `linux-generic` is used. Accepts either a literal type UUID or a symbolic type identifier. For a list of supported type identifiers, see the `Type=` setting in [repart.d(5)](repart.d.html).","#MatchPartitionType=",251],
[4,12,"When the target `Type=` is picked as `partition`, selects the GPT partition UUID and partition flags to use for the updated partition. Expects a valid UUID string, a hexadecimal integer, or booleans, respectively. If not set, but the source match pattern includes wildcards for these fields (i.e. \"`@u`\", \"`@f`\", \"`@a`\", or \"`@g`\"), the values from the patterns are used. If neither configured with wildcards or these explicit settings, the values are left untouched. If both the overall `PartitionFlags=` flags setting and the individual flag settings `PartitionNoAuto=` and `PartitionGrowFileSystem=` are used (or the wildcards for them), then the latter override the former, i.e. the individual flag bit overrides the overall flags value. See [Discoverable Partitions Specification](https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/discoverable_partitions_specification) for details about these flags.\n\nNote that these settings are not used for matching, they only have effect on newly written partitions in case a transfer takes place.","#PartitionUUID=",251],
[4,13,"Controls whether to mark the resulting file, subvolume or partition read-only. If the target type is `partition` this controls the ReadOnly partition flag, as per [Discoverable Partitions Specification](https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/discoverable_partitions_specification), similar to the `PartitionNoAuto=` and `PartitionGrowFileSystem=` flags described above. If the target type is `regular-file`, the writable bit is removed from the access mode. If the target type is `subvolume`, the subvolume will be marked read-only as a whole. Finally, if the target `Type=` is selected as `directory`, the \"immutable\" file attribute is set, see [chattr(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chattr.1.html) for details.","#ReadOnly=",251],
[4,14,"The UNIX file access mode to use for newly created files in case the target resource type is picked as `regular-file`. Expects an octal integer, in typical UNIX fashion. If not set, but the source match pattern includes a wildcard for this field (i.e. \"`@t`\"), the value from the pattern is used.\n\nNote that this setting is not used for matching, it only has an effect on newly written files when a transfer takes place.","#Mode=",251],
[4,15,"These options take positive, decimal integers, and control the number of attempts done and left for this file. These settings are useful for managing kernel images, following the scheme defined in [Automatic Boot Assessment](https://systemd.io/AUTOMATIC_BOOT_ASSESSMENT), and only have an effect if the target pattern includes the \"`@d`\" or \"`@l`\" wildcards.","#TriesDone=",251],
[4,16,"Takes a decimal integer equal to or greater than 2. This configures how many concurrent versions of the resource to keep. Whenever a new update is initiated it is made sure that no more than the number of versions specified here minus one exist in the target. Any excess versions are deleted (in case the target `Type=` of `regular-file`, `directory`, `subvolume` is used) or emptied (in case the target `Type=` of `partition` is used; emptying in this case simply means to set the partition label to the special string \"`_empty`\"; note that no partitions are actually removed). After an update is completed the number of concurrent versions of the target resources is equal to or below the number specified here.\n\nNote that this setting may be set differently for each transfer. However, it generally is advisable to keep this setting the same for all transfers, since otherwise incomplete combinations of files or partitions will be left installed.\n\nIf the target `Type=` is selected as `partition`, the number of concurrent versions to keep is additionally restricted by the number of partition slots of the right type in the partition table. I.e. if there are only 2 partition slots for the selected partition type, setting this value larger than 2 is without effect, since no more than 2 concurrent versions could be stored in the image anyway.","#InstancesMax=",251],
[4,17,"Takes a boolean argument. If this option is enabled (which is the default) before initiating an update, all left-over, incomplete updates from a previous attempt are removed from the target directory. This only has an effect if the target resource `Type=` is selected as `regular-file`, `directory` or `subvolume`.","#RemoveTemporary=",251],
[4,18,"Takes a symlink name as argument. If this option is used, as the last step of the update a symlink under the specified name is created/updated pointing to the completed update. This is useful in to provide a stable name always pointing to the newest version of the resource. This is only supported if the target resource `Type=` is selected as `regular-file`, `directory` or `subvolume`.","#CurrentSymlink=",251],
